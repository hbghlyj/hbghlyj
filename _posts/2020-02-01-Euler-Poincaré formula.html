The Euler-Poincaré formula describes the relationship
of the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of faces
of a manifold.
It has been generalized to include potholes and holes that penetrate the
solid.  To state the Euler-Poincaré formula, we need the following
definitions:
</p><ul>
     <li> $V$: the number of vertices </li>
     <li> $E$: the number of edges </li>
     <li> $F$: the number of faces </li>
     <li> $G$: the number of holes that penetrate the solid, usually
          referred to as <i>genus</i> in topology </li>
     <li> $S$: the number of <i>shells</i>.  A shell is an internal void
          of a solid.  A shell is bounded by a 2-manifold surface, which can
          have its own genus value. Note that the solid itself is counted
          as a shell.  Therefore, the value for $S$ is at least 1.</li>
     <li> $L$: the number of loops, all outer and inner loops of faces
          are counted.  </li>
</ul>
Then, the Euler-Poincaré formula is the following:$$V - E + F - (L - F) - 2(S - G) = 0$$

<h3> Examples </h3>

<ul>
     <li> A cube has eight vertices ($V = 8$), 12 edges ($E = 12$)
          and six faces ($F = 6$), no holes and one shell ($S=1$);
          but $L= F$ since each face has only one outer loop.
          Therefore, we have $$V-E+F-(L-F)-2(S-G) = 8-12+6-(6-6)-2(1-0)     = 0$$
</li>
     <li> The following solid has 16 vertices, 24 edges, 11 faces, no holes,
          1 shell and 12 loops (11 faces + one inner loop on the top face).
          Therefore,$$V-E+F-(L-F)-2(S-G) = 16-24+11-(12-11)-2(1-0)=0$$

          loops on top and bottom faces).  Therefore,$$V-E+F-(L-F)-2(S-G) = 16-24+10-(12-10)-2(1-1)=0$$<center>

     <li> The following solid has a penetrating hole and an internal cubic
          chamber as shown by the right cut-away figure.  It has 24 vertices,
          12*3 (cubes) = 36 edges, 6*3 (cubes) - 2 (top and bottom
          openings) = 16 faces, 1 hole
          (<i>i.e.</i>, genus is 1), 2 shells and 18 loops (16 faces + 2
          inner loops on top and bottom faces).  Therefore,$$V-E+F-(L-F)-2(S-G) = 24-36+16-(18-16)-2(2-1)=0$$

Part of the information recorded in a B-rep is topological (<i>i.e.</i>,
adjacency relations).  Invalid solids may be generated if the representation
is not carefully constructed.  One way of checking this topological
invalidity is to use the Euler-Poincaré formula.  If its value is not zero,
we are sure something must be wrong in the representation.  However, this is
only a <i>one-side</i> test.  More precisely, a zero value of the
Euler-Poincaré formula does not mean the solid is valid.

The figure above has a box and an additional sheet which is simply a
rectangle.  This object has 10 vertices, 15 edges, 7 faces, 1 shell and no
hole.  Its loop number is equal to the number of faces.  The value of
the Euler-Poincaré formula is zero as shown below,
$$V-E+F-(L-F)-2(S-G) = 10-15+7-(7-7)-2(1-0)=0$$
</p><p>
but this is <i>not</i> a valid solid!  Therefore, if the value of
Euler-Poincaré formula is non-zero, the representation is definitely not a
valid solid. However, the value of the Euler-Poincaré formula being zero does
not guarantee the representation would yield a valid solid.

</p><h3> How to count genus correctly? </h3>
<p>

It is not always easy to count genus $G$ correctly.  For example,
suppose we have a sphere punched by three tunnels as shown below.  The left 
object shows the outside look.  The right one shows the inside by cutting half
of the sphere off.  What is the genus value $G$?  We know that the genus
value counts the number of penetrating holes.  But, in this example, it is
somewhat ambiguous.  In fact, by combining any two center-going tunnels we
will have three penetrating holes.  However, this is incorrect!

The Euler-Poincaré Formula describes the topological property amount
vertices, edges, faces, loops, shells and genus.  Any topological transformation
applied to the model will <i>not</i> alter this relationship.  Intuitively,
applying topological transformations means we can twist, stretch and squash
the model but we cannot cut some parts off nor glue some parts together.  
Let us apply some intuitive topological transformations to this model for
computing the genus.  We can push the "walls" surrounding the
three tunnels so that the interior of the model becomes a thin shell.
This is shown in the image below.

Stretch the top hole so that it is large enough (below left).
Then, collapse the top portion to flatten the model.  This is shown in the
right model below.  How many penetrating holes are there?  Two!  Therefore, $G=2$.

Sometimes, penetrating holes may appear in an unlikely situation.  Consider
the following model which is obtained by taking out a torus and tube from the
interior of a sphere.  What is the genus of this model?  It does not look like 
there is a penetrating hole.  So, is genus equal to 0?  In fact, $G= 1$!  
Figure it out yourself. Do some twisting, stretching and squashing.
