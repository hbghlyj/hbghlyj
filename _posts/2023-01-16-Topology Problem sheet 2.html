<h1>Product topology, basis</h1>
<div class="q">Consider $ℝ^n$ endowed with the norm ‖ ‖$_∞$.
<ol>
    <li>Prove that for any $𝐱∈ℝ^n$ and $ε>0$, there is a $𝐲∈ℚ^n$ and $δ∈ℚ, δ>0$, such that
    \[
    𝐱∈B(𝐲, δ)⊂B(𝐱, ε) \text {. }
    \]
    </li>
    <li>Prove that the family $\{B(𝐲, δ): 𝐲∈ℚ^n$ and $δ∈ℚ, δ>0\}$ is a countable basis for the Euclidean topology on $ℝ^n$.</li>

Pick $δ∈ℚ∩(0,ε/2)$. Since $ℚ^n$ is dense in $ℝ^n,∃𝐲∈ℚ^n$ such that $𝐱∈B(𝐲, δ)$.<br>
$∀𝐳∈B(𝐲, δ):{‖𝐱-𝐳‖}_∞≤{‖𝐱-𝐲‖}_∞+{‖𝐲-𝐳‖}_∞&lt;2δ&lt;ε$. So $B(𝐲, δ)⊂B(𝐱, ε)$.</li>
<li>For any open set $B$ in $ℝ^n$, $∀𝐱∈B,∃ε:B(𝐱,ε)⊂B$.<br>By (1), $∃𝐲∈ℚ^n$ and $δ∈ℚ^+$ such that $𝐱∈B(𝐲, δ)⊂B(𝐱, ε)$, therefore $B$ is the union of all $B(𝐲, δ)⊂B$.<br>
So $\{B(𝐲, δ): 𝐲∈ℚ^n$ and $δ∈ℚ, δ>0\}$ is a basis for the Euclidean topology on $ℝ^n$.<br>It is countable because $B(𝐲,δ)↦(𝐲,δ)$ is a bijection to $ℚ^n×ℚ^+$.</li>

    Prove that if $f: X→Y$ is a continuous map of a space $X$ to a Hausdorff space $Y$, then its graph\[G=\set{(x, f(x))∈X×Y: x∈X}\]is a closed subset of $X×Y$.
</div>
<div class="noprint"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_graph_theorem">Closed graph theorem</a><br><a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/367155">Why is the graph of a continuous function to a Hausdorff space closed?</a></div>
Let $(x,y)∈(X×Y)∖G$. Since $y$ and $f(x)$ are distinct points in $Y$, and $Y$ is Hausdorff, ∃ disjoint open sets $U∋y$ and $V∋f(x)$ in $Y$. Since $f$ is continuous, $W=f^{-1}(V)$ is an open neighborhood of $x$.<br>
$W×U$ is an open neighborhood of $(x,y)$ in  the product topology. We will show it is disjoint from $G$.<br>
Let $(z,f(z))$ be any point of $G$. If $z∉W$, then clearly $(z,f(z))∉W×U$. If $z∈W$, then $f(z)∈V$, so $f(z)∉U$, and therefore $(z,f(z))∉W×U$. Thus, in all cases $(z,f(z))∉W×U$, and it follows that $(W×U)∩G=∅$. Thus, each point of $(X×Y)∖G$ has an open neighborhood disjoint from $G$, and $G$ is therefore closed.
<h1>Connectedness</h1>
<div class="q">
<ol>
<li>Let $A$ and $B$ be connected subsets of a topological space $X$ such that $A∩\bar{B}≠∅$. Prove that $A∪B$ is connected.</li>
<li>Which of the following subsets of $ℝ^2$ are connected?
<ul>
<li>$B((1,0),1)∪B((-1,0),1)$;</li>
<li>$\overline{B((1,0),1)}∪B((-1,0),1)$;</li>
<li>the set of all points with at least one rational coordinate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Suppose $A∪B$ is disconnected, then $A∩B=∅$ and ∃ disjoint open sets $Y,Z$ such that $A∪B⊂Y∪Z$ and $(A∪B)∩Y∩Z=∅$ and $(A∪B)∩Y,(A∪B)∩Z≠∅$.<br>
Since $(A∪B)∩Y∩Z=∅$, we have $A∩Y∩Z=∅$, also $A⊂Y∪Z$, but $A$ is connected, say $A⊂Y$, then $A∩Z=∅$ and $B∩Z=(A∪B)∩Z≠∅$, but $B$ is connected, we have $B⊂Z$.<br>
Since $B⊂X∖Y$ and $X∖Y$ is closed, we have $\bar B⊂X∖Y$, but $A⊂Y$, so $A∩\bar{B}=∅$, contradiction.
<li><ul><li>$B((1,0),1),B((-1,0),1)$ are disjoint open sets, so $B((1,0),1)∪B((-1,0),1)$ is disconnected.</li>
<li>$\overline{B((1,0),1)}∩\overline{B((-1,0),1)}≠∅$, by (1) $\overline{B((1,0),1)}∪B((-1,0),1)$ is connected.</li>
<li>Denote the set by $A$. For any $(x,y)∈A$, wlog let $x$ be rational. Consider the polyline Γ from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ to $(x,y)$. Any point on Γ has a rational coordinate, so Γ$⊂A$, so $A$ is path connected, so $A$ is connected.</li>
</ul></li></ol>
<div class="q">
Let $X$ be a topological space.<ol>
<li>Let $a$ be an arbitrary point in $X$. Prove that there exists a largest connected subset of $X$ containing $a$, i.e. a set $C_a$ such that:

<li>$a∈C_a$ and $C_a$ is connected;</li>
<li>for any connected subset $S$ of $X$ containing $a, S⊂C_a$.</li></ol>
We call such a set $C_a$ the <i>connected component of $X$ containing $a$</i>, or simply a <i>connected component</i> of $X$.</li>

<li>Prove that the relation $x∼y⇔y∈C_x$ is an equivalence relation.</li>
<li>Prove that connected components of $X$ are either disjoint or they coincide.</li>
<li>Find the connected components of $X=\set{(x, y)∈ℝ^2: x≠y}$ with the topology induced from $ℝ^2$.<br>
Same question for $X=\set{(z, w)∈ℂ^2: z≠w}$ with the topology induced from $ℂ^2$.</li>
<li>Let $A$ be a subset of ℝ such that $\mathring A=∅$. Prove that the connected components of $A$ are the singletons.<br>
What are the connected components of ℚ with the topology induced from ℝ ?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ol><li>Consider all connected subsets of $X$ containing $a$. Since they intersect in $a$, the union is connected, so it is the largest connected subset of $X$ containing $a$.</li>
<li>$C_a$ is connected, by Theorem 1.85, $\overline{C_a}$ is a connected subset of $X$ containing $a$, so $\overline{C_a}⊂C_a$, so $C_a$ is closed.</li>
<li>If $y∈C_x$, then $C_x$ is a connected subset of $X$ containing $y$, by definition $C_x⊂C_y$, so $x∈C_y$.<br>Now $C_y$ is a connected subset of $X$ containing $x$, by definition $C_y⊂C_x$, so $C_x=C_y$.<br>$x∼y⇔C_x=C_y$ is clearly an equivalence relation.</li>
<li>By (3), connected components are equivalence classes, so they are disjoint.</li>
<li>$X=X_1∪X_2$ where $X_1=\set{(x, y)∈ℝ^2: x&lt;y},X_2=\set{(x, y)∈ℝ^2: x>y}$ are disjoint, open and connected. So they are the connected components of $X$.<hr>$X=\set{(z, w)∈ℂ^2: z≠w}=ℂ^2∖\set{(z, z):z∈ℂ}$ is the complement of a 2D space in a 4D space, we guess $X$ is connected.

Finally, since $Y∩Y^⟂=\{0\}$ and $Y^⟂≅ℝ^2$ and $ℝ^2∖\{0\}$ is connected, there is a path connecting $x_1,x_2$ in $Y^⟂∖\{0\}⊂X$.</li>
<li>Let $X$ be any connected component of $A$. Since $X$ is connected in ℝ, it is an interval.<br>Since $X⊂A,\mathring A=∅$, we have $\mathring X=∅$, so $X$ is a singleton.
<br>In particular, $\mathring ℚ=∅$, so any connected component of ℚ is singleton.</li>
</ol>The set of path connected components of $X$ is $π_0 (X) = [S^0, X]_+$<br>

$π_1 (X) = [S^1, X]_+$ is the fundamental group.<br>$π_n (X, X_0) = [S^n, X]_+$ are Abelian groups, called higher homotopy groups.

Let $I$ be an open interval in ℝ and let $f: I→ℝ$ be a differentiable function.
<ol>
    <li>Prove that the set $T=\{(x, y)∈I×I: x&lt;y\}$ is a connected subset of $ℝ^2$ with the standard topology.</li>
    <li>
        Let $g: T→ℝ$ be the function defined by

        Prove that $g(T)⊂f'(I)⊂\overline{g(T)}$.

    <li>Show that $f'(I)$ is an interval.</li>

<i>Thus the derivative $f'$ of any differentiable function $f: I→ℝ$ always has the intermediate value property (without necessarily being continuous).</i><br>
This is <i>Darboux's theorem</i>.
</div>
<i>Remark.</i> intermediate value property ⇔ preserve connectedness.
<ol>
    <li>Any 2 points in $T$, $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),x_1&lt;y_1,x_2&lt;y_2$ can be connected by a line $t(x_1,y_1)+(1-t)(x_2,y_2),t∈[0,1]$, since $tx_1+(1-t)x_1&lt;ty_2+(1-t)y_2$. So $T$ is path connected. So $T$ is connected.</li>
    <li>Let $(x,y)∈T$. By the Mean-Value Theorem, $∃c∈(x,y)⊂I$ such that
        $$
        g(x,y) = \frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} = f'(c)∈f'(I).

        As $(x,y)∈T$ is arbitrary, $g(T)⊂f'(I)$.<br>
        Next, since $I$ is open, $∀x∈I,∃$ a sequence $(y_n)_{n∈ℕ}$ in $I$ such that $x&lt;y_n∀n∈ℕ$ and $\lim_{n→∞}y_n=x$.

        $$As $x∈I$ is arbitrary, $f'(I)⊂\overline{g(T)}$.

    <li>By (1), $T$ is connected, since $g$ is continuous on $T$, $g(T)$ is connected. By (2), $g(T)⊂f'(I)⊂\overline{g(T)}$, by Theorem 1.85, $f'(I)$ is connected.</li>

<h1>Compactness</h1>
<div class="q">

    <li>Let $X$ be a compact space, and let $\left(V_n\right)_{n∈ℕ}$ be a nested sequence of non-empty closed subsets of $X$ (<i>nested</i> means that $V_{n+1}⊂V_n$ for every $\left.n∈ℕ\right)$. Prove that $⋂_{n=1}^∞ V_n≠∅$.</li>
    <li>Now suppose that $X$ is Hausdorff as well as compact, and let $f: X→X$ be a continuous map. Let $X_0=X, X_1=f\left(X_0\right)$ and inductively define $X_{n+1}=f\left(X_n\right)$ for $n \geq 1$. Show that $A=⋂_n X_n$ is non-empty.</li>

By continuity of $f$, $X_n$ closed ⇒ $X_{n+1}=f(X_n)$ closed.<br>

Summary: any (continuous) self-map of a compact Hausdorff space has fixed subset.<br>
“have fixed subset” doesn't imply “have fixed point” e.g. rotation of a circle<br>
Note: rotation of a sphere has fixed points (2 poles)<br>
Fact: Any map $f:𝔻^n→𝔻^n$ has a fixed point.
