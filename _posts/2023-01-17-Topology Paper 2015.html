<ol type="a"><li>
<ol type="i"><li>A topological space $X$ is disconnected if there are disjoint open non-empty subsets $U$ and $V$ such that $U ∪ V=X$. If $X$ is not disconnected, it is called connected.<br>
A (non-empty) subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is connected if $A$ with the subspace topology is connected.
</li>
<li>Assume that $A ∪ B$ is disconnected. Then there are open subsets of $X, U, V$, such that
$$
(A ∪ B) ∩ U ≠ ∅,(A ∪ B) ∩ V ≠ ∅,(A ∪ B) ∩ U ∩ V=∅
$$
Let $x ∈ A ∩ B$. Then $x ∈ U$ or $x ∈ V$. Say $x ∈ U$. Since $A$ is connected $A ⊂ U$. For the same reason $B ⊂ U$. So $(A ∪ B) ∩ V=∅$, a contradiction.
</li>
<li>Assume that $f(A)$ is not connected. Let $U$ and $V$ be open sets such that
$$
f(A) ∩ V ≠ ∅, f(A) ∩ U ≠ ∅, f(A) ∩ V ∩ U=∅
$$
Then $f^{-1} 1(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$ are open in $X$. So, $f^{-1}(U) ∩ A$ and $f^{-1}(V) ∩ A$ are disjoint and open in $A$. Since $A$ is connected, one of $f^{-1}(U) ∩ A$ and $f^{-1}(V) ∩ A$ is empty. Hence, one of $f(A) ∩ U$ and $f(A) ∩ V$ is empty. So, $f(A)$ is connected.
</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="i"><li>Let $ℬ=\left\{U × V: U ⊂ 𝒯_{X}, V ⊂ 𝒯_{Y}\right\}$. Clearly $X × Y ⊂ ℬ$. Also
$$
\left(U_{1} × V_{1}\right) ∩\left(U_{2} × V_{2}\right)=\left(U_{1} ∩ U_{2} × V_{1} ∩ V_{2}\right)
$$
hence $\left(U_{1} × V_{1}\right) ∩\left(U_{2} × V_{2}\right)$ lies in $ℬ$. So $ℬ$ is a basis for a topology.</li>
<li>Assume that $X, Y$ are Hausdorff. Let $(x, y) ≠\left(x' y'\right)$. Then either $x ≠ x'$ or $y ≠ y'$. Without loss of generality we assume that $x ≠ x'$. Then there exist $U, V$ open disjoint in $X$ with $x ∈ U, x' ∈ V$. It follows that $(x, y) ∈ U × Y,\left(x' y'\right) ∈ V × Y$ and $U × Y ∩ V × Y=∅$. So $X × Y$ is Hausdorff.<br>
Conversely we show that $X$ is Hausdorff: Let $x, x' ∈ X$ with $x ≠ x'$. Given $y ∈ Y$ there are open sets $U_{1}, U_{2}$ in $X, V_{1}, V_{2}$ in $Y$ such that
$$
(x, y) ∈ U_{1} × V_{1},\left(x', y\right) ∈ U_{2} × V_{2}, U_{1} × V_{1} ∩ U_{2} × V_{2}=∅
$$
Then $x ∈ U_{1}, x' ∈ U_{2}$ and $U_{1} ∩ U_{2}=∅$. The same argument applies to $Y$.
</li>
<li>We show first a lemma: If $C$ and $A_{i}, i ∈ I$ are connected sets in a topological space $Z$ and $A_{i} ∩ B ≠ ∅$ for all $i$ then $F=C ∪ \bigcup_{i ∈ I} A_{i}$ is connected. Indeed let $U, V$ be open subsets of $Z$ such that $U ∩ V ∩ F=∅$ and $F ⊂ U ∪ V$. If $C ∩ U ≠ ∅$ then $C ⊂ U$ since $C$ is connected. For the same reason $A_{i} ⊂ U$ for all $i$. It follows that $F ⊂ U$. We argue similarly if $C ∩ V ≠ ∅$. It follows that either $F ∩ U$ or $F ∩ V$ is empty. So $F$ is connected.<br>
Let $x_{0} ∈ X-A, y_{0} ∈ Y-B$.
$$
X × Y∖ A × B=X ×(Y-B) ∪ Y ×(X-A)
$$
Each set $X ×\{y\}$ with $y ∈ Y-B$ is connected and intersects $\left\{x_{0}\right\} × Y$. So by the lemma $X ×(Y-B) ∪\left\{x_{0}\right\} × Y$ is connected. By the same argument $Y ×(X-A) ∪ X ×\left\{y_{0}\right\}$ is connected. $\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\right)$ lies in both these sets so their union which is equal to $X ×(Y-B) ∪ Y ×(X-A)$ is connected by part (a ii).
</li>
<li>Let $A ⊂ X$ be finite and let let $a ∈ A$. If $A=\{a\}$ clearly $A$ is connected. Otherwise if $B=A∖\{a\}$, then $X∖ B, X∖\{a\}$ are open sets, $A ⊂(X∖ B) ∪(X∖\{a\})$ and $(X∖ B) ∩(X∖\{a\}) ∩ A=∅$ so $A$ is not connected. If $A$ is infinite and $U, V$ are open non-empty then $A ∩ U ∩ V ≠ ∅$ so $A$ is connected.<br>
Let $A=\{a, b\} × X$. Then $U=X∖\{a\}, V=X∖\{b\}$ are open in $X$ so $U × X, V × X$ are open in $X × X, A ∩(U × X) ∩(V × X)=∅$ and $A ⊂(U × X) ∪(V × X)$. So $A$ is not connected.

<ol type="i"><li>A family $𝒰=\left\{U_{i}: i ∈ I\right\}$ of subsets of a space $X$ is called a cover if $X=\bigcup_{i ∈ I} U_{i}$ If each $U_{i}$ is open in $X$ then $𝒰$ is called an open cover for $X$. A subcover of a cover $\left\{U_{i}: i ∈ I\right\}$ for a space $X$ is a subfamily $\left\{U_{j}: j ∈ J\right\}$ for some subset $J ⊂ I$ such that $\left\{U_{j}: j ∈ J\right\}$ is still a cover for $X$. We call it a finite subcover if $J$ is finite. A topological space $X$ is compact if any open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.</li><li>Let $\left\{U_{i}: i ∈ I\right\}$ be an open cover of $Y$. Then $\left\{f^{-1}\left(U_{i}\right): i ∈ I\right\}$ is an open cover of $\mathrm{X}$. The compactness of $X$ implies that there exists a finite subcover $\left\{f^{-1}\left(U_{j}\right): j ∈ J\right\}$ Since $f$ is onto, $\left\{U_{j}: j ∈ J\right\}$ is a finite subcover for $Y$.
</li></ol>

<li>
<ol type="i"><li>Let $X / ℛ$ be the set of equivalence classes of $ℛ$. The quotient topology $𝒯'$ of $X / ℛ$ consists of the sets $U$ such that $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. Clearly $∅, X / ℛ$ lie in $𝒯'$. Let $U_{1}, U_{2} ∈ 𝒯'$. Then $p^{-1}\left(U_{1} ∩ U_{2}\right)=p^{-1}\left(U_{1}\right) ∩ p^{-1}\left(U_{2}\right)$ so $U_{1} ∩ U_{2} ∈ 𝒯'$. Also if $\left\{U_{i}: i ∈ I\right\} ⊂ 𝒯'$ then
$$
p^{-1}\left(\bigcup U_{i}\right)=\bigcup p^{-1}\left(U_{i}\right)
$$
so $\bigcup U_{i}$ lies in $𝒯'$.</li>
<li>Suppose that $g$ is continuous. By the definition of the quotient topology $p$ is continuous. So, $g ∘ p$ is continuous.<br>
Suppose that $g ∘ p$ is continuous. Let $U$ be an open subset of $Z$. Then, by assumption, $(g ∘ p)^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$. This is $p^{-1} \left(g^{-1}(U)\right)$. By the definition of the quotient topology, $g^{-1}(U)$ is therefore open in $X / ℛ$. So, $g$ is continuous.
</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="i"><li>We note that $p$ is injective on $K$. So $p^{-1}(p(X-K))=X-K$. It follows that $p(X-K)$ is open.
</li>
<li>Let $f:[0,1] → S^{1}$ where $f(t)=e^{2 π i t}$. Since $f(0)=f(1)$, this gives a well-defined function $g: X_{A} → S^{1}$ where $g([x])=f(x)$. So $f=g ∘ p$ and $g$ is continuous by (b,ii). Since $X=[0,1]$ is compact $X_{A}$ is compact as well. As $S^{1}$ is Hausdorff and $g 1-1, g$ is a homeomorphism.
</li>
<li>Let $f:[0,1] → X_{A}$ where $f(x)=[x]$. Then $f$ is the restriction of $p$ to $[0,1]$ so it is continuous. As $[0,1]$ is compact and $f$ is onto $X_{A}$ is compact. Let $h:[0,1] → S^{1}$ where $h(t)=e^{2 π i t}$. This gives a well-defined 1-1 and onto function $g: X_{A} → S^{1}$ where $g([x])=h(x)$ if $x ∉ A$ and $g([x])=h(0)=h(1)$ if $x ∈ A$. So $h$ is the restriction of $g ∘ p$ to $[0,1]$ and $g$ is continuous by (b,ii). Since $X_{A}$ is compact and $S^{1}$ is Hausdorff $g$ is a homeomorphism.
</li>
<li>Let $[a],[b] ∈ X_{ℤ}$. If $a, b ∉ ℤ$ pick open neighborhoods $U, V$ of $a, b$ in $ℝ$ such that $U ∩ V=∅$ and $U ∩ ℤ=∅, V ∩ ℤ=∅$. Then by (i) $p(U), p(V)$ are disjoint open containing respectively $[a], [b]$. If, say $a ∈ ℤ$, let $m=\min \{∣ n-b ∣ ; b ∈ ℤ\}$. If $ϵ=m / 3$ then the sets $U=\bigcup_{n}(n-ϵ, n+ϵ), V=(b-ϵ, b+ϵ)$ are an open saturated sets $[a] ∈ p(U),[b] ∈ p(V)$ and $p(U) ∩ p(V)=∅$. So $X_{ℤ}$ is Hausdorff.<br>
Let $a, b$ be distinct irrational numbers. Then if $U, V$ are open sets containing $[a],[b]$ respectively, $p^{-1}(U), p^{-1}(V)$ both intersect $ℚ$. It follows that $U ∩ V ≠ ∅$ so $X_{ℚ}$ is not Hausdorff.
</li>
<li>Let $S$ be a countable subset of $ℝ$. For each $n ∈ ℕ$ we pick $x_{n} ∈(n, n+1)$ with $x_{n} ∉ S$. The sets $K_{r}=\left\{x_{n}: n ∈ ℕ, n ≥ r\right\}$ are all closed disjoint from $S$. So by (c, i) $p\left(X-K_{r}\right)$ is open in $X_{S}$. Clearly $X_{S}=\bigcup_{r} p\left(X-K_{r}\right)$ and this open cover has no finite subcover, so $X_{S}$ is not compact.</li></ol></li></ol>
