<h1>Solution</h1><ol><li>
<ol type="a"><li>
<ol type="i"><li>$X$ is compact if for every open cover $\left\{U_α\right\}$ of $X$, i.e. $U_α$ are open and $⋃_α U_α ⊇ X$, there is a finite sub-cover, that is, there are finite many $α_1, ⋯, α_N$ (for some $N ∈ ℕ$), $⋃_{i=1}^N U_{α_i} ⊇ X$.<br>
$X$ is connected, if $X=U ∪ V$, where $U, V$ are open and disjoint: $U ∩ V=∅$, then $U=X$ or ∅ (so similarly $V=∅\text{ or }X$).
</li>
<li>$f: X → Y$ is continuous if for every open set $V ⊆ Y, f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. [Equivalent definitions are acceptable too]
</li>
<li>Let $\left\{V_α\right\}$ be an open cover of $f(X)$, since $f: X → Y$ is continuous, $U_α=f^{-1}\left(V_α\right)$ is open in $X$. Since $⋃_α V_α ⊇ f(X)$, for every $x ∈ X, f(x) ∈f(X) ⊆ ⋃_α V_α$. Hence there is $α$ such that $f(x) ∈ V_α$, which implies that $x ∈ U_α$. Therefore $\left\{U_α\right\}$ is an open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is compact, so there are finite many $α_1, ⋯, α_N$ such that $⋃_{i=1}^N U_{α_i} ⊇ X$. Then by definition, $⋃_{i=1}^N V_{α_i} ⊇ f(X)$, $\left\{V_{α_1}, ⋯, V_{α_N}\right\}$ is a finite sub-cover of $f(X)$, so that $f(X)$ is compact.
</li>
<li>Let $X=ℝ$ and $Y=[-1,1], f(x)=\sin x$ is continuous and onto from $X$ to $Y$, but $X$ is not compact.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="i"><li>$ρ(x, y) ≥ 0, ρ(x, y)=ρ(y, x)$ are clear. Also
$$
ρ(x, y)=\frac{d(x, y)}{1+d(x, y)}=0
$$
is equivalent to that $d(x, y)=0$ so is equivalent to that $x=y$. To show the triangle inequality we use the following elementary inequality: for $s ≥ 0$ and $t ≥ 0$
$$
\frac{s}{1+s}+\frac{t}{1+t}=\frac{s+t+2 s t}{1+s+t+s t} ≥ \frac{s+t+s t}{1+s+t+s t} ≥ \frac{s+t}{1+s+t}
$$
or via the equality
$$
\frac{s}{1+s}+\frac{t}{1+t}-\frac{s+t}{1+s+t}=\frac{s t(s+t+2)}{(1+s+t)(1+s+t+s t)} ≥ 0
$$
so by setting $s=d(x, y)$ and $t=d(y, z)$ to obtain that
\begin{aligned}
ρ(x, y)+ρ(y, z) & =\frac{d(x, y)}{1+d(x, y)}+\frac{d(y, z)}{1+d(y, z)} ≥ \frac{d(x, y)+d(y, z)}{1+d(x, y)+d(y, z)} \\
& ≥ \frac{d(x, z)}{1+d(x, z)} ≥ ρ(x, z)
\end{aligned}
which shows that $ρ$ is a metric on $X$.
</li>
<li>Since, by definition, $ρ(x, y) ≤ d(x, y)$, hence if $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect $d$, so is with respect $ρ$. Conversely, suppose $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is Cauchy with respect to $ρ$, by definition $ρ\left(a_n, a_m\right) → 0$ as $n, m → ∞$, hence for every $ε>0$, there is $N$ such that
$$
ρ\left(a_n, a_m\right)<\frac12\min \{ε, 1\}   \text { for } n, m ≥ N .
$$
Therefore
$$
d\left(a_n, a_m\right)=\frac{ρ\left(a_n, a_m\right)}{1-ρ\left(a_n, a_m\right)}≤\frac{ρ\left(a_n, a_m\right)}{1-\frac12}=2 ρ\left(a_n, a_m\right)&lt;ε   \text { for } n, m ≥ N
$$
so by definition, $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is Cauchy with respect to $d$.
</li>
<li>Suppose $U$ is open in $(X, d)$, then for every $a ∈ U$, there is $ε>0$ such that the open ball in $(X, d)$
$$
\{x ∈ X: d(x, a)&lt;ε\} ⊆ U
$$
Let $δ=\frac{1}{2} \min \{ε, 1\}$. If $ρ(x, a)&lt;δ$, then
$$
d(x, a)=\frac{ρ(x, a)}{1-ρ(x, a)} ≤ 2 ρ(x, a)&lt;ε
$$
which implies that
$$
\{x ∈ X: ρ(x, a)&lt;δ\} ⊆\{x ∈ X: d(x, a)&lt;ε\} ⊆ U .
$$
By definition, $U$ is open in $(X, ρ)$.<br>
Conversely, if $U$ is open in $(X, ρ)$, then for every $a ∈ U$ there is $ε>0$ such that $\{x ∈ X: ρ(x, a)&lt;ε\} ⊆ U$. Since $ρ ≤ d$ we must have
$$
\{x ∈ X: d(x, a)&lt;ε\} ⊆\{x ∈ X: ρ(x, a)&lt;ε\} ⊆ U
$$
and therefore $U$ is open in $(X, d)$.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="i"><li>$d$ is a metric on $ℓ_∞$ because it is clearly nonnegative and symmetric, and as in part (b)
\begin{aligned}
d(x, y)+d(y, z) & =\sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k}\left(\frac{\left|x_k-y_k\right|}{1+\left|x_k-y_k\right|}+\frac{\left|y_k-z_k\right|}{1+\left|y_k-z_k\right|}\right) \\
& ≥ \sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{\left|x_k-z_k\right|}{1+\left|x_k-z_k\right|}=d(x, z)
\end{aligned}
so the triangle inequality holds. Therefore $d$ is a metric on $ℓ_∞$.
</li>
<li>Any finite sequence of numbers must be bounded, so $A ⊂ ℓ_∞$. Let $a=\left(a_k\right) ∈ U$. Then there is $ε>0$ such that $\left\{x ∈ ℓ_∞: d(x, a)&lt;ε\right\} ⊆ U$.
Choose $N$ such that $\sum_{k=N+1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k}&lt;ε$ and $x_k=a_k$ for $k=1, ⋯, N$ and $x_k=0$ for $k ≥ N+1$. Then $x=\left(x_k\right) ∈ A$, and
$$
d(x, a)=\sum_{k=N+1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{\left|a_k\right|}{1+\left|a_k\right|} ≤ \sum_{k=N+1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k}&lt;ε
$$
so that $x ∈ U$ and therefore $A ∩ U ≠ ∅$.
</li>
<li>Suppose $x^{(n)}=\left(x_k^{(n)}\right)_{k ≥ 1}$ (where $n=1,2, ⋯$) is a Cauchy sequence in $\left(ℓ_∞, d\right)$, then for every $k=1,2, ⋯$
$$
0 ≤ \frac{\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|}{1+\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|} ≤ 2^k d\left(x^{(n)}, x^{(m)}\right) → 0
$$
as $n, m → ∞$. By part (b)(ii), $\left\{x_k^{(n)}\right\}_{n ≥ 1}$ is Cauchy in ℂ.<br>
Conversely suppose $\left\{x_k^{(n)}\right\}_{n ≥ 1}$ is Cauchy in ℂ for every $k$. Let $ε>0$. Since $\sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k}<∞$, there is $M$ such that $\sum_{k=M+1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k} ≤ \fracε{2}$. Now for each $k$, since $\left\{x_k^{(n)}\right\}_{n ≥ 1}$ is Cauchy, there is an $N_k$, such that
$$
\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|<\fracε{2}   \text { for any } n, m ≥ N_k
$$
Let $N=\max \left\{N_1, ⋯, N_M\right\}$. Then for $n, m ≥ N$ we have\begin{aligned}
d\left(x^{(n)}, x^{(m)}\right) & =\sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|}{1+\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|}\\& ≤ \sum_{k=1}^M \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|}{1+\left|x_k^{(n)}-x_k^{(m)}\right|}+\sum_{k=M+1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k} \\
& &lt;\sum_{k=1}^M \frac{1}{2^k} \fracε{2}+\fracε{2}&lt;ε
\end{aligned}
so $\left\{x^{(n)}\right\}$ is Cauchy sequence in $\left(ℓ_∞, d\right)$.
</li>
<li>Suppose $a=\left(a_k\right), b=\left(b_k\right) ∈ ℓ_∞$, then
$$
d(T(a), T(b))=\sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^k} \frac{\left|a_{k+1}-b_{k+1}\right|}{1+\left|a_{k+1}-b_{k+1}\right|}=2 \sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \frac{\left|a_{k+1}-b_{k+1}\right|}{1+\left|a_{k+1}-b_{k+1}\right|} .
$$
Thus if $a_1=b_1=0$, then
$$
d(T(a), T(b))=2 d(a, b)
$$
so $T$ is not a contraction. If $T(a)=a$, if and only if $a=\left(a_1, a_1, ⋯\right)$ is a constant sequence.<br>
On the other hand,
$$
d(S(a), S(b))=\sum_{k=1}^∞ \frac{1}{2^{k+1}} \frac{\left|a_k-b_k\right|}{1+\left|a_k-b_k\right|}=\frac{1}{2} d(a, b)
$$
so $S$ is a contraction mapping. Hence $S$ has a unique fixed point $(0,0, ⋯)$.</li></ol></li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="a"><li>A metric space $X$ is path-connected, if for every $x, y ∈ X$, there is a continuous path $p:[0,1] → X$ such that $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$.<br>
Suppose $X$ is path-connected, and suppose $X=U ∪ V$ where $U$ and $V$ are open and disjoint. If both $U, V$ are non-empty, take $x ∈ U$ and $y ∈ V$. Since $X$ is path-connected, there is a continuous mapping $p:[0,1] → X$ such that $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$. Then $[0,1]=p^{-1}(U) ∪ p^{-1}(V)$, both $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$ are open, disjoint and non-empty as $0 ∈ p^{-1}(U)$ and $1 ∈ p^{-1}(V)$, which contradicts to the fact that $[0,1]$ is connected.
</li>
<li>
<ol type="i"><li>$A$ is not path-connected. if a continuous function $p:[0,1] → ℝ$ satisfies that $p(0)=0$ and $p(1)=1$, then it attains any value between 0 and 1, such as $\sqrt{2} / 2$ which does not belong to $A$, so $p$ can not be a continuous path in $A$.
</li>
<li>The subset $B$ is path-connected. Any point in
$$
\left\{(x, y) ∈ ℝ^2: x y>1 \text { and } x>1\right\}
$$
can be connected to $(1,1) ∈ B$ by a straight line, and any point $(x, y)$ with $x>0$ in
$$
\left\{(x, y) ∈ ℝ^2: x y ≤ 1 \text { and } x ≤ 1\right\}
$$
can be connected to the curve $\{(x, y): x y=1,0&lt;x ≤ 1\}$ hence connected by continuous path to $(1,1)$. Any $(x, y) ∈ B$ with $x ≤ 0$ can be connected to $(1,1)$ by a straight line, so $B$ is path-connected.
</li>
<li>$C$ is path-connected, as any two points in the set $C$ can be connected by straight line to for example $(0,0,3)$.
</li>
<li>The subset $D$ is not connected, so not path-connected. In fact, let
$$
U=\left\{(x, y) ∈ ℝ^2: x&lt;1\right\} ∩ D
$$
and
$$
V=\{(x, y): 1&lt;x&lt;2\} ∩ D .
$$
Then both $U$ and $V$ are open in $D$, disjoint, and non-empty, and $D=U ∪ V$.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol type="i"><li>If there is a point $x ∈ A ∩ B$, then $d(A, B) ≤ d(x, x)=0$ so $d(A, B)=0$. For disjoint closed $A$ and $B$, it is not necessary to have $d(A, B)>0$. For example, $A=\{(x, y): x y=1\}$ and $B=\{(x, 0): x ≥ 0\}$. Then both $A$ and $B$ are closed disjoint subsets of $ℝ^2$, and $d(A, B)=0$.
</li>
<li>By definition $\{d(a, x): a ∈ A\}$ is bounded below and non-empty, so $d(A,\{x\})$ exists. For every $n$, there is $a_n ∈ A$ such that
$$
d(A,\{x\}) ≤ d\left(a_n, x\right) ≤ d(A,\{x\})+\frac{1}{n}
$$
for every $n=1,2, ⋯$. Since $A$ compact metric space, so it is sequential compact so there is a convergent sub-sequence say $a_{n_k}$ such that $a_{n_k} → a$. Then $a ∈ A$ so $x ≠ a$, and moreover
$$
d(A,\{x\})=\lim_{k → ∞} d\left(a_{n_k}, x\right)=d(a, x)>0 .
$$
</li>
<li>By definition, $\bar{A}$ is defined to be the least closed set which contains $A$, that is $\bar{A}=∩\{F: F$ is closed and $F ⊇ A\}$. Consider $f(x)=d(A,\{x\})$.
\begin{aligned}
d(A,\{x\}) & =\inf \{d(a, x): a ∈ A\} ≤ \inf \{d(a, y)+d(x, y): a ∈ A\} \\
& =\inf \{d(a, y): a ∈ A\}+d(x, y) \\
& =d(A,\{y\})+d(x, y)
\end{aligned}
and similarly
$$
d(A,\{y\}) ≤ d(A,\{x\})+d(x, y)
$$
The previous two inequalities together imply that
$$
{|f(x)-f(y)|} ≤ d(x, y)

for every $x, y ∈ X$. In particular $f$ is continuous on $X$, so that $\{x ∈ X: d(A,\{x\})=0\}$ is closed, and contains $A$ as $f(x)=0$ for $x ∈ A$. Suppose $F ⊇ A$ is closed. If $d(A,\{x\})=0$, and $x ∉ A$, then by definition for every $ε>0$ there is $a_ε ∈ A$ such that $d\left(a_ε, x\right)&lt;ε$, that is $(A∖\{x\}) ∩ B(x, ε) ≠ ∅$, Since $F^c$ is open and $A ∩ F^c=∅$, hence $x ∉ F^c$ and therefore $x ∈ F$, that is

<li>By Heine-Borel theorem, $A ⊂ ℝ^2$ is compact if and only if $A$ is closed and bounded.<br>Conversely, suppose any continuous function $f$ is bounded above and $f(A)$ has a maximum. Suppose $A$ is not compact, then by Heine-Borel theorem, $A$ is unbounded or not closed. If $A$ is unbounded, then there is a sequence $x_n$ such that $\left|x_n\right| → ∞$. But $f(x)={|x|}$ is continuous on $A$ and is not bounded above, which is a contradiction. If $A$ is not closed but bounded, then there is a sequence $a_n ∈ A$, such that $a_n → a$ but $a ∉ A$. Consider the function

f(x)=\frac{1}{|x-a|}

Applying this with $M_n=n^{-t}$, we see that $\sum n^{-z}$ converges uniformly on $H_t$. Since each summand is holomorphic on $H_t$, part (b) implies that $\sum n^{-z}$ is holomorphic on $H_t$. It follows that the sum is holomorphic on $⋃_{t&gt;1} H_t$, which is $H_1$, as required.</li></ol>

We have

&=\sum_{n=0}^{∞} \frac{w^n}{2^n n !} z^n \sum_{n=0}^{∞}(-1)^n \frac{w^n}{2^n n !} z^{-n}
\end{aligned}
The two series converge absolutely for $z ≠ 0$, so we may rearrange and collect the terms with $z^0$ to obtain:
$$
J_0(w)=\sum_{n=0}^{∞}(-1)^n \frac{w^{2 n}}{4^n n !^2}
$$
</li>
<li>Let $γ$ trace the unit circle with positive orientation. Then, by Laurent's Theorem, and taking $z=e^{i θ}$,
\begin{aligned}
J_n(w) &=\frac{1}{2 π i} ∫_γ \exp \left(\frac{w}{2}\left(z-\frac{1}{z}\right)\right) \frac{d z}{z^{n+1}} \\
&=\frac{1}{2 π i} ∫_{-π}^π \exp \left(\frac{w}{2}\left(e^{i θ}-e^{-i θ}\right)\right) \frac{i e^{i θ}}{e^{i(n+1) θ}} d θ \\

&=\frac{1}{2 π} ∫_{-π}^π \cos (-n θ+w \sin θ)+i \sin (-n θ+w \sin θ) d θ
\end{aligned}
Since $-n θ+w \sin θ$ is odd, $\sin (-n θ+w \sin θ)$ is also odd, and so the integral is equal to

\frac{1}{2 π} ∫_{-π}^π \cos (-n θ+w \sin θ) d θ .

<li>The residue of $f$ at $a$ is the coefficient $c_{-1}$ in the Laurent expansion of $f$ around $a$.<br>Residue Theorem: Let $f$ be holomorphic inside and on a closed, positively oriented contour $γ$ except at a finite number of poles $a_1, …, a_n$. Then
$$
∫_γ f(z) d z=2 π i \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{res}\left(f ; a_i\right) .
$$
</li>
<li>Consider the function
$$
f(z)=\frac{\exp (i k z)}{(x+b)^2+a^2} .
$$
We use a semicircular contour $γ$ :
The function $f$ has simple poles at $-b ± i a$, of which $-b+i a$ lies inside the contour (for large enough $R$ ). The residue at $-b+i a$ is
$$
\left.\frac{\exp (i k z)}{2(z+b)}\right|_{z=-b+i a}=\frac{\exp (-k a-i b k)}{2 a i} .
$$
By Cauchy's Residue Theorem,
$$
∫_g f(z) d z=π \exp (-k a-i b k) / a
$$
which has real part $π \exp (-k a) \cos (b k) / a$.
Now the integral along $γ_R$ converges to 0 as $R → ∞$, as $|\exp (i k z)| ≤$ 1 in the upper half plane and so by the Estimation Theorem
$$
\left|∫_{γ_R} f(z) d z\right| ≤ π R ⋅ \frac{1}{(R-b)^2-a^2} → 0 .
$$
The required integral is the real part of $\lim_{R → ∞} ∫_{γ_0} f(z) d z$ which equals $π \exp (-k a) \cos (b k) / a$.
</li>
<li>Let
$$
f(z)=\frac{z^t}{z^2+1}
$$
and let $γ$ be the following contour, where the outer circle has radius $R$, the inner circle has radius $ϵ$, and the contours $γ_{ ±}$lie just above and below the axis:<br>We define a branch of the logarithm on $ℂ \backslash[0, ∞)$ by $\log (z)=\log {|z|}+i \arg (z)$, where $\arg (z) ∈(0,2 π)$, and correspondingly $z^t=\exp ((t) \log (z)$.
The function $f$ has simple poles at $z= ± i$, with residues
$$
\left.\frac{z^t}{2 z}\right|_{z=i}=\frac{1}{2 i} \exp (i π t / 2)
$$
and
$$
\left.\frac{z^t}{2 z}\right|_{z=-i}=-\frac{1}{2 i} \exp (3 i π t / 2)
$$
So
\begin{aligned}
∫_γ f(z) d z &=2 π i\left(\frac{1}{2 i} \exp (i π t / 2)-\frac{1}{2 i} \exp (3 i π t / 2)\right) \\
&=π(\exp (i π t / 2)-\exp (3 i π t / 2)) .
\end{aligned}
Now on $ρ$, we have $|f(z)| ≤ R^t /\left(R^2-1\right)$, and so by the Estimation Theorem
$$
\left|∫_ρ f(z) d z\right| ≤ 2 π R ⋅ R^t /\left(R^2-1\right) \text {, }
$$
which tends to 0 as $R → ∞$, as $t ∈(-1,1)$.
On $γ_ϵ$, for small $ϵ$, we have $|f(z)| ≤ 2 ϵ^t$, and so again by the Estimation Theorem we get
$$
\left|∫_{γ_ϵ} f(z) d z\right| ≤ 2 π ϵ ⋅ 2 ϵ^t=4 π ϵ^{1+t}
$$
which tends to 0 as $ϵ → 0$.
Finally, we have
$$
∫_{γ_+} f(z) d z+∫_{γ_-} f(z) d z=\left(1-e^{2 π i t}\right) ∫_ϵ^R f(x) d x,
$$
as Log has an extra $+2 π i$ on $γ_-$, and we are integrating in the reverse direction.<br>
So taking $ϵ → 0$ and $R → ∞$, we obtain $\left(1-e^{2 π i t}\right) ∫_0^{∞} f(x) d x=π\left(e^{i π t / 2}-e^{3 i π t / 2}\right)$, and so
\begin{aligned}
∫_0^{∞} f(x) d x &=\frac{π\left(e^{i π t / 2}-e^{3 i π t / 2}\right)}{1-e^{2 π i t}} \\
&=π e^{i π t / 2} \frac{1-e^{i π t}}{1-e^{2 π i t}} \\
&=π e^{i π t / 2} \frac{1}{1+e^{π i t}} \\
&=π \frac{1}{e^{-π i t / 2}+e^{π i t / 2}} \\
&=\frac{π}{2 \cos (π t / 2)}

<ol type="a"><li><ol type="i"><li>Holomorphic function $f: R → ℂ$ is conformal on $R$ if $f'(z) ≠ 0$ for every $z ∈ R$.
</li>
<li>By (i) $f'(z) ≠ 0$. Let $g=f^{-1}$. Let $w_0 ∈ G$. We show that $g'\left(w_0\right)$ exists and $g'\left(w_0\right) ≠ 0$. If $w ∈ G$ such that $w ≠ w_0$, then by injectivity $z=g(w) ≠ z_0=g\left(w_0\right)$. By open mapping theorem, $g$ is continuous. Therefore as $w → w_0$, we have $z → z_0$. Hence
$$
\frac{g(w)-g\left(w_0\right)}{w-w_0}=\frac{z-z_0}{f(z)-f\left(z_0\right)}=\frac{1}{\frac{f(z)-f\left(z_0\right)}{z-z_0}} → \frac{1}{f'\left(z_0\right)}
$$
as $w → w_0$ exists and does not vanish. Therefore $g$ is conformal.
</li>
<li>The answer is yes, by Riemann conformal mapping theorem, as $H$ is simply connected. Explicitly we may construct conformal mapping by applying Möbius transformations. Pick any point $a ∈ H$ which is sent to 0, so that its symmetric point against $∂ H$ (the real line), $\bar{a}$ is mapped to $∞$. Hence
$$
f(z)=e^{i θ} \frac{z-a}{z-\bar{a}}
$$
where $θ$ is a real number, which has an inverse obtained by solving $z$ in terms of $w=f(z)$, that is,
$$
z=\frac{\bar{a} w-a e^{i θ}}{w-e^{i θ}}
$$
Simple computation leads to the following relation that
$$
ℑ z=\frac{1-{|w|}^2}{\left|w-e^{i θ}\right|^2} ℑ a
$$
so that $z∈H⇔ℑz>0⇔{|w|}&lt;1⇔w∈D$ which shows that $f:H→D$ is bijective.
</li>
<li>Suppose $f$ is holomorphic from ℂ to $H$, then by part (iii), the mapping
$$
z → \frac{f(z)-i}{f(z)+i}
$$
is holomorphic from ℂ to the unit disk, hence, by the Liouville theorem, this holomorphic function must be constant. That is
$$
\frac{f(z)-i}{f(z)+i}=A
$$
for some $A$ with ${|A|}&lt;1$. Hence
$$
f(z)=\frac{2 i}{1-A}-i
$$
is a constant.</li></ol>

<ol type="i"><li>Let $C_1:{|z-2|}=2$ and $C_2:{|z-3|}=1$, two circles, tangent at $z=4$. Let us apply the Möbius transformation
$$
f_1(z)=\frac{1}{z-4}
$$
which sends 4 to $∞$, so the two circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ are mapped to two parallel lines $l_1$ and $l_2$.<br>$f_1$ preserves the real axis, and two circles are orthogonal to real axis. Therefore $l_1$ and $l_2$ must be orthogonal to real axis too. Since 0 and $z=2+2 i$ are two points lying on $C_1$, and
$$
f_1(0)=-\frac{1}{4},   \text { and } f_1(2+2 i)=\frac{1}{-2+2 i}=-\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{1-i}=-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{4} i
$$
hence $l_1$ is the line that $ℜ z=-\frac{1}{4}$. Now $2 ∈ C_2$ and
$$
f_1(2)=-\frac{1}{2}
$$
so $l_2$ is the line having equation $ℜ z=-\frac{1}{2}$. Since $1 ∈ R_1$ and $f(1)=-\frac{1}{3}$, thus the range $R_1$ is mapped one-to-one onto the strip that $-\frac{1}{2}&lt;ℜ z&lt;-\frac{1}{4}$. Now the mapping $f_2(z)=4 π\left(z+\frac{1}{2}\right)$ sends the strip $-\frac{1}{2}&lt;ℜ z<-\frac{1}{4}$ to the strip $0&lt;ℜ z&lt;π$. Apply $f_3(z)=\exp (i z)$ which maps the strip $0&lt;ℜ z&lt;π$ to $H$. Therefore
$$
f(z)=f_3 ∘ f_2 ∘ f_1(z)=\exp \left(\frac{4 π i}{z-4}+2 π i\right)=\exp \left(\frac{4 π i}{z-4}\right)
$$
is a conformal mapping sending $R_1$ one-to-one and onto $H$.
</li>
<li>Sketch the range $R_2$ we discover that the circle $C_3:|z-i|=2$ has two cutting points with $C_4: ℑ z=0$ at $x$ where $|x-i|^2=4$, solve $x$ to obtain $x= ± \sqrt{3}$. Now we apply a Möbius transformation which sends $-\sqrt{3}$ to 0 and $\sqrt{3}$ to $∞$, thus $C_3$ and $C_4$ are mapped to two lines through the origin $l_3$ and $l_4$. We may use
$$
f_1(z)=\frac{z+\sqrt{3}}{z-\sqrt{3}} .
$$
It is clear that the Möbius transformation $f_1$ preserves real axis (i.e. $C_4$, the line $ℑ z=0$ ), or by checking that $0 ∈ C_4$ and $f_1(0)=-1$ so that $l_4$ must be the real axis.
Now $3 i ∈ C_3$ and
$$
f_1(3 i)=\frac{3 i+\sqrt{3}}{3 i-\sqrt{3}}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i,
$$
which implies that $l_3$ is the line $\arg z=-\frac{π}{3}$. Since $i ∈ R_2$ and
$$
f_1(i)=\frac{i+\sqrt{3}}{i-\sqrt{3}}=-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i
$$
which yields that
$$
f_1\left(R_2\right)=\left\{z ∈ ℂ:-π<\arg z<-\frac{π}{3}\right\} .
$$
Rotating the range by $π$, i.e. $f_2: z → e^{i π} z=-z$ mapping $f_1\left(R_2\right)$ to the range that $0<\arg z<\frac{2}{3} π$, which is the wedge with angle $\frac{2}{3} π$ then enlarging the wedge angle by conformal mapping $f_3: z → z^{\frac{3}{2}}$ which sends the wedge to $H$, where
$$
f_3(z)=z^{\frac{3}{2}}=\exp \left[\frac{3}{2} \ln z\right]
$$
where $\ln z=\ln {|z|}+i \arg z$ where $0<\arg z&lt;2 π$ is the principal branch of log. Together with Part (a)(iii) we conclude that
$$
f(z)=f_4 ∘ f_3 ∘ f_2 ∘ f_1(z)
$$
where $f_3(z)=e^{i θ} \frac{z-a}{z-\bar{a}}(ℑ a>0$ and $θ$ is real as parameters). That is
$$
f(z)=e^{i θ} \frac{\exp \left[\frac{3}{2} \ln \frac{\sqrt{3}+z}{\sqrt{3}-z}\right]-a}{\exp \left[\frac{3}{2} \ln \frac{\sqrt{3}+z}{\sqrt{3}-z}\right]-\bar{a}}
$$
sends $R_2$ one-to-one onto conformly to the unit disk $D$.
Another method: One can apply $f_1(z)=\frac{z-\sqrt{3}}{z+\sqrt{3}}$ instead at the first step, the other steps are similar. $l_4$ is still the real axis. Since
$$
f_1(3 i)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i,   f_1(i)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i
$$
so that the range $f_1\left(R_2\right)$ is given by $-\frac{2}{3} π&lt;\arg z&lt;0$, therefore we conclude that
$$
f(z)=e^{i θ} \frac{\exp \left[\frac{3}{2} \ln \left(e^{\frac{2}{3} π i} \frac{z-\sqrt{3}}{z+\sqrt{3}}\right)\right]-a}{\exp \left[\frac{3}{2} \ln \left(e^{\frac{2}{3} π i} \frac{z-\sqrt{3}}{z+\sqrt{3}}\right)\right]-\bar{a}}
$$
