    Let $\def\d{\mathrm{d}}\d$ be one of the metrics $\d_1,\d_2,\d_∞$ on $ℝ^n$.

</div>There is a sequence $(a_n,b_n)∈K×F,\d(a_n,b_n)&lt;\dist(K,F)+\frac1n$. Since $K$ is compact, there is a subsequence $a_{n_k}$ converging to some $a∈K$ with $\d(a_{n_k},a)&lt;\frac1{n_k}$.<br>Let $F_k=B(a,\dist(K,F)+\frac2{n_k})∩F$.

    Let $(X,𝒯)$ be a topological space and let $C=X∪\{∞\}$ where $∞$ denotes some extra point not in $X$.

If $K=∅$ then $U∈𝒯⊂𝒯'$. Suppose $K≠∅$, then $∞∈U$. Also $X∖U=V∩⋂_{j∈J}(X∖U_j)$ is a closed subset of $V$ so it is compact in $X$, thus compact in $C$. Hence $U∈𝒯'$.</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>For $U_1,U_2∈𝒯'$, we prove $U_1∩U_2∈𝒯'$.</dt><dd>If $∞∉U_1,U_2$ then $U_1,U_2∈𝒯⇒U_1∩U_2∈𝒯⊂𝒯'$.</dd><dd>If $∞∈U_1,∞∉U_2$ then $∞∉U_1∩U_2$ and $U_1∖\{∞\},U_2∈𝒯$, so $U_1∩U_2=(U_1∖\{∞\})∩U_2∈𝒯⊂𝒯'$.</dd><dd>If $∞∈U_1,U_2$ then $∞∈U_1∩U_2$ and $X∖U_1,X∖U_2$ are compact$⇒(X∖U_1)∪(X∖U_2)=X∖(U_1∩U_2)$ is compact$⇒U_1∩U_2∈𝒯'$.</dd></dl>
So $(C,𝒯')$ is a topological space, we prove it is compact: Let $\left(U_i\right)_{i∈I}$ be an open covering of $C$. There exists $i_0∈I$ such that $∞∈U_{i_0}$. Then
$$
U_{i_0}=(X-G)∪\{∞\},
$$
where $G$ is compact. The $U_i$ cover $G$, therefore there exists a finite subset $J$ of $I$ such that $\left(U_i\right)_{i∈J}$ covers $G$ Then$$C=U_{i_0}∪\left(\bigcup_{i∈J} U_i\right) .
$$The steorographic projection is a homeomorphism from the 2-sphere to the one-point compactification of $ℝ^2$.

    Let $l^∞$ be the space of bounded real sequences, with the norm ${‖𝐱‖}_∞=\sup _{n∈ℕ}\left|x_n\right|$, where $𝐱=\left(x_n\right)_{n∈ℕ}$.<br>Prove that the closed unit ball of $l^∞$, $B'(𝟎, 1)=\set{‖𝐱‖∈l^∞:{‖𝐱‖}_∞≤1}$, is not compact.<br>
    Thus, $B'(𝟎, 1)$ is a closed bounded subset in a complete normed vector space which is not compact.
</div>
Let the $n$th term of $𝐱_n$ be 1 and others be 0. For any $n$, ${‖𝐱_n‖}=1⇒𝐱_n∈B'(𝟎, 1)$. Also ${‖𝐱_i-𝐱_j‖}=1$ for any $i,j$. So the sequence $(𝐱_n)$ doesn't contain Cauchy sequence. So $B'(𝟎, 1)$ is not sequentially compact, thus not compact.
