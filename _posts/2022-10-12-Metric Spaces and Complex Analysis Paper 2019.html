<ol type="a"><li>Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space, and $φ$ be a non-decreasing function on $[0, ∞)$ such that $φ(0)=0, φ(t)&gt;0$ for $t&gt;0, φ$ is continuous at 0, and $φ(s+t)⩽φ(s)+φ(t)$ for all $s, t⩾0$. Define $ρ(x, y)=φ(d(x, y))$ for $x, y ∈ X$.
<ol type="i"><li>Show that $ρ$ is a metric on $X$.</li>
<li>Show that $x_{n} → x$ in $(X, d)$ implies that $x_{n} → x$ in $(X, ρ)$. Is the converse also true? That is, if $x_{n} → x$ in $(X, ρ)$, is it true that $x_{n} → x$ in $(X, d)$ too? Justify your answer.</li>
<li>Show that there is a bounded metric $d'$ on $X$ which is equivalent to $d$ in the sense that $d\left(x_{n}, x\right) → 0$ if and only if $d'\left(x_{n}, x\right) → 0$ as $n → ∞$
</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of a metric space $X$. Show that $\bar{A} ∪ \bar{B}=\overline{A ∪ B}$, where $\bar{A}$ denotes the closure of a subset $A$. Is it true that $\overline{A ∩ B}=\bar{A} ∩ \bar{B}$ ?<br>
Give an example of subsets $A$ and $B$ of $ℝ$, such that $A ∩ \bar{B}$ and $\bar{A} ∩ B$, are different.</li>
<li>Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.

<li>Suppose $(X, d)$ is compact and non-empty, and $g: X → X$ is mapping such that $d(g(x), g(y))&lt;d(x, y)$ for any $x, y ∈ X, x ≠ y$. Show that there is a unique $x_{0} ∈ X$ such that $g\left(x_{0}\right)=x_{0}$.

<li>Let $Y$ be the vector space of all convergent real sequences $a=\left(a_{n}\right)_{n⩾0}$ with $\lim_{n → ∞} a_{n}=0$, equipped with the norm $‖a‖=\sup_{n⩾0}\left|a_{n}\right|$. Let $d(a, b)=‖a-b‖$ for $a=\left(a_{n}\right)_{n⩾0} ∈ Y$ and $b=\left(b_{n}\right)_{n⩾0} ∈ Y$, where $a-b$ is the sequence $\left(a_{n}-b_{n}\right)_{n⩾0}$. You may assume that $d$ is a metric on $Y$.<br>
Let $B=\{a ∈ Y:‖a‖⩽1\}$ be the closed unit ball of $Y$. Consider the mapping $F: B → Y$ defined as the following. If $a=\left(a_{n}\right)_{n⩾0} ∈ B$ then $F(a)=\left(ξ_{n}\right)_{n⩾0}$ is given by$$
ξ_{0}=\frac12(1+‖a‖),   ξ_{n}=a_{n-1}\left(1-\frac1{2^{n}}\right) \text { for } n⩾1 .$$Show that $F$ maps $B$ into $B$, and moreover show that$$

<h1>Solution</h1><ol><li>
<ol type="a"><li>
<ol type="i"><li>Since $φ ≥ 0$, so $ρ(x, y)=φ(d(x, y)) ≥ 0$. Since $d(x, y)=d(y, x)$
$$
ρ(x, y)=φ(d(x, y))=φ(d(y, x))=ρ(y, x)
$$
By assumption, $φ(t)=0$ only when $t=0$, hence $ρ(x, y)=φ(d(x, y))=0$ implies that $d(x, y)=0$, so that $x=y$ as $d$ is a metric. Finally verify that $ρ$ also satisfies the triangle inequality. If $x, y$ and $z$ in $X$, we have $d(x, z)≤d(x, y)+d(y, z)$, so that, by using the assumptions on $φ$ we have
\begin{aligned}
ρ(x, z) &=φ(d(x, z))\\&≤φ(d(x, y)+d(y, z))\\&≤φ(d(x, y))+φ(d(y, z)) \\
&=ρ(x, y)+ρ(y, z) .
\end{aligned}
Therefore $ρ$ is a metric on $X$.
</li>
<li>Suppose $x_n → x$ in $(X, d)$, i.e. $d\left(x_n, x\right) → 0$, since $φ$ is (right) continuous at 0, $φ\left(d\left(x_n, x\right)\right) → 0$, that is, $ρ\left(x_n, x\right) → 0$.<br>
The converse is also true, we may argue by contradiction. Suppose $ρ\left(x_n, x\right) → 0$ but $d\left(x_n, x\right)$ does not tend to zero, thus there is $ε&gt;0$ and there is a sub-sequence $\left\{x_{n_k}\right\}$ such that $d\left(x_{n_k}, x\right) ≥ ε$, $φ$ is non-decreasing implies that $ρ\left(x_{n_k}, x\right) ≥ φ(ε)&gt;0$ for all $k$, which is a contradiction.
</li>
<li>We may choose $φ(t)=\frac{t}{1+t}$ and $ρ(x, y)=φ(d(x, y))$.<center>{% latex %}\usepackage{tikz}

\frac{t+s}{1+t+s}=\frac{t}{1+t+s}+\frac{s}{1+s+t}≤\frac{t}{1+t}+\frac{s}{1+s}
$$
for all $s, t ≥ 0$, that is, $φ(s+t)≤φ(s)+φ(t)$. Therefore, by a) and b), $d'=ρ$ is a metric equivalent to $d$. While $d'(x, y)≤1$ for all $x, y ∈ X$.</li></ol>

<li>Since $A ⊆ \overline{A ∪ B}$ so $\bar{A} ⊆ \overline{A ∪ B}$ and similarly $\bar{B} ⊆ \overline{A ∪ B}$. On the other hand $A ∪ B ⊆ \bar{A} ∪ \bar{B}$ and $\bar{A} ∪ \bar{B}$ is closed, we therefore have $\overline{A ∪ B} ⊆ \bar{A} ∪ \bar{B}$. Hence $\bar{A} ∪ \bar{B}=\overline{A ∪ B}$.<br>In general $\overline{A ∩ B}=\bar{A} ∩ \bar{B}$ is false, for example $A=ℚ$ and $B=ℝ∖ ℚ$. Then $A ∩ B=∅$ but $\bar{A}=\bar{B}=ℝ$.
Moreover $A ∩ \bar{B}=ℚ, \bar{A} ∩ B=ℝ∖ ℚ, \overline{A ∩ B}=∅$ and $\bar{A} ∩ \bar{B}=ℝ$ are different.

<ol type="i"><li>$f: X → X$ is a contraction if there is a constant $0≤c&lt;1$ such that $d(f(x), f(y))≤c d(x, y)$ for every $x, y ∈ X$. The Contraction Mapping Theorem says that if $f: X → X$
is a contraction on a complete metric space $(X, d)$, then $f$ has a unique point, i.e. there is a unique $x ∈ X$, such that $f(x)=x$.
</li>
<li>Let us consider the function $F(x)=d(g(x), x)$ for $x ∈ X$. Then
\begin{aligned}
|F(x)-F(y)| &=|d(g(x), x)-d(g(y), y)| \\
&=|d(g(x), x)-d(x, g(y))+d(x, g(y))-d(g(y), y)| \\
&≤d(g(x), g(y))+d(x, y) \\
&≤2 d(x, y)
\end{aligned}
for all $x, y$, hence $F$ is continuous on $X$. Since $X$ is compact, $F$ achieves its minimum on $X$, that is, there is $x_0 ∈ X$, such that
$$
d\left(g\left(x_0\right), x_0\right)=\inf_{x ∈ X} d(g(x), x)
$$
If $g\left(x_0\right) ≠ x_0$, then $d\left(g^2\left(x_0\right), g\left(x_0\right)\right)&lt;F\left(x_0\right)$ by assumption, so that $F\left(g\left(x_0\right)\right)&lt;F\left(x_0\right)$ which contradicts to the claim $x_0$ is the inf of $F$. Thus $x_0$ must be a fixed point of $g$.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Suppose $a ∈ B$, then $F(a)=ξ=\left(ξ_n\right)$ given in the question possesses the following properties:
$$
ξ_n=a_{n-1}\left(1-\frac1{2^n}\right) → 0   \text { as } n → ∞
$$
and
$$
\left|ξ_0\right|=\frac12(1+‖a‖)&lt;1
$$
While for $n ≥ 1$ we have
$$
\left|ξ_n\right|=\left|a_{n-1}\right|\left(1-\frac1{2^n}\right) ≤\left|a_{n-1}\right| ≤‖a‖
$$
so by definition $‖ξ‖≤1$, and therefore $F(a) ∈ B$ for every $a ∈ B$.<br>
Suppose $a=\left(a_n\right), b=\left(b_n\right) ∈ B$, and let $ξ=F(a)$ and $F(b)=η$. Then $ξ_0-η_0=\frac12({‖a‖}-{‖b‖})$ and for $n ≥ 1$
$$
ξ_n-η_n=\left(a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\right)\left(1-\frac1{2^n}\right)
$$
so that
$$
\left|ξ_0-η_0\right|≤\frac12‖a-b‖
$$
and for $n ≥ 1$
$$
\left|ξ_n-η_n\right| ≤\left(1-\frac1{2^n}\right)\left|a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\right|
$$
If $a ≠ b$, then $‖a-b‖&gt;0$. Since $a_n-b_n → 0$ so there is $N ∈ ℕ,\left|a_{n-1}-b_{n-1}\right|≤\frac12‖a-b‖$ for $n ≥ N$. Hence
$$
\left|ξ_n-η_n\right| ≤\left[\left(1-\frac1{2^N}\right) ∨ \frac12\right]‖a-b‖
$$
for all $n$, it follows that
$$
‖F(a)-F(b)‖ ≤\left[\left(1-\frac1{2^N}\right) ∨ \frac12\right]‖a-b‖&lt;‖a-b‖
$$
as long as $a ≠ b$.<br>
We are going to show that $F$ has no fixed point. Argue by contradiction. Suppose $a=F(a)$ where $a=\left(a_n\right) ∈ B$. Then, by definition of $F$
$$
a_0=\frac12(1+‖a‖)
$$
and
$$
a_n=a_{n-1}\left(1-\frac1{2^n}\right)
$$
for $n ≥ 1$. It follows that
$$
a_n=\prod_{k=1}^n\left(1-\frac1{2^k}\right) a_0=\frac12(1+‖a‖) \prod_{k=1}^n\left(1-\frac1{2^k}\right)
$$
which does not converge to zero, a contradiction to the assumption that $a ∈ B$. By part (c), one can conclude that $B$ is not compact. [An argument by using unit vectors is also fine].

<ol type="a"><li>$X$ is connected if $X=U ∪ V$ where $U, V$ are open and disjoint, then $U$ or $V$ is empty.<br>
$X$ is path-connected, if for every $x, y ∈ X$ there is a continuous mapping $γ$ from $[0,1]$ to $X$ such that $γ(0)=x$ and $γ(1)=y$.

<li>
<ol type="i"><li>Suppose $f: X →\{0,1\}$ is continuous. Let $U=f^{-1}(0)$ and $V=f^{-1}(1)$. Then $U, V$ are open (also closed), disjoint and $X=U ∪ V$. If $X$ is connected, then $U$ or $V$ is empty, so $f(x)=0$ for all $x$, or $f(x)=1$ for all $x$, accordingly. Conversely, if $X$ is disconnected, so that $X=U ∪ V$ where $U, V$ are open disjoint and both are nonempty. Define $f(x)=0$ for $x ∈ U$, and $f(x)=1$ for $x ∈ V$. Then $f$ is continuous, and $f$ is not constant.
</li>
<li>Let us prove that $X ⊆ ℝ$ is connected if and only if $X=J$ is an interval. First prove any interval is connected. If $X$ is an interval with end points $a≤b$. If $a=b$ then $X=[a, a]=\{a\}$ which is connected. Otherwise we argue by contradiction. Suppose $f: X →\{0,1\}$ is continuous, so $f$ is also a continuous function from $X$ to $[0,1]$. If $f$ is not constant, then there are $x, y ∈ X$ such that $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=1$. We may assume that $x&lt;y$. Since $X$ is an interval, so that $[x, y] ⊆ X$ and $f$ is continuous on $[x, y]$. By IVT, there is $z ∈[x, y]$ such that $f(z)=1 / 2$, which is a contradiction.<br>
Conversely, assume that $X$ is connected, we show that $X$ is an interval, that is, if $x&lt;y$ and $x, y ∈ X$, we need to show that $(x, y) ⊆ X$. Argue by contradiction. Suppose $c ∈(x, y)$ but $c ∉ X$. Let $U=X ∩(-∞, c)$ and $V=X ∩(c, ∞)$. Then $U, V$ are open and disjoint, $x ∈ U, y ∈ V$, and $X=U ∪ V$ as $c ∉ X$. Thus $X$ is disconnected, a contradiction.
</li>
<li>Suppose $X$ is path-connected, and we show that $X$ is connected. Again argue by contradiction. Suppose $X$ is disconnected, that is $X=U ∪ V$ where $U, V$ are open, disjoint and both non-empty. Let $x ∈ U$, and $y ∈ V$. Since $X$ is path-connected, so there is a continuous map $p:[0,1] → X$ such that $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$. Then
$$
[0,1]=p^{-1}(U) ∪ p^{-1}(V)
$$
where $p^{-1}(U), p^{-1}(V)$ are open, disjoint, and no one is empty, which would yield that the interval $[0,1]$ is disconnected, a contradiction.</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Suppose $X ⊆ ℝ^n$ is open and connected. Let $a ∈ X$ be any but fixed point, and let $A=\{x ∈ X: x$ can be connected to $a\}$, i.e. $A$ consists of all points $x ∈ X$, such that there is a continuous $p:[0,1]→X$ such that $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=a$. We show that both $A$ and $A^c$ are open. Suppose $x ∈ A$, then also $x ∈ X$. Since $X$ is open in $ℝ^n$, so there is $r&gt;0$, the open ball $B(x, r) ⊆ X$. Since any point $y ∈ B(x, r)$ can be connected to the center $x$ then to $a$, so that $B(x, r) ⊆ A$. Therefore $A$ is open. Similar argument shows that if $A^c$ were non-empty, then $A^c$ is open too. Since $X$ is connected, and $A$ is non-empty, so that $A=X$ which implies that $X$ is path-connected.
</li>
<li>Suppose there is 1-1 onto continuous $f:[0,1] → S^1$, then $f$ maps disconnected space $[0, c) ∪(c, 1]$ one to one and onto $S^1∖\{a\}$ where $a=f(c)$, and $c ∈(0,1)$. Since $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous, and $f^{-1}$ maps a connected space $S^1∖\{a\}$ to a disconnected one, which produces a contradiction.<br>

<li>By letting $h∈ℝ$ go to zero, we obtain that, if $f=u+v i$ is holomorphic,

f'(z)=u_x+v_x i

and therefore
$$
u_x+v_x i=\frac1{i}\left(u_y+v_y i\right)

Suppose $|f(z)|≤M$ for any $z ∈ ℂ$, where $M$ is a bound of $f$ in $ℂ$. Then, by the Estimation Lemma,
\begin{aligned}

&=\frac1{R^n} M
\end{aligned}
for any $R&gt;0$. Therefore, for $n ≥ 1$, by letting $R → ∞$ we conclude that $\left|a_n\right|≤0$, so $a_n=0$ for all $n ≥ 1$, hence $f(z)=a_0$ is constant.</li></ol>

for any $n ∈ ℤ$ and $0&lt;ρ&lt;r$. Letting $ρ ↓ 0$, then $ρ^{-n} → 0$ if $-n&gt;0$, so that $c_{-n}=0$ for $n=1,2, ⋯$. Therefore
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^∞ c_n(z-b)^n \text { for } 0&lt;|z-b|&lt;r

The right-hand side defines a holomorphic function on $D(b, r)$, including $b$ too, so $b$ is removable.

<li>For the last part, we introduce $h(z)=\sin z+\cos z$ whose zeros are isolated. In fact

h(z)=\sqrt2 \sin \left(z+\frac{π}{4}\right)

so its zeros are $a_n=n π-\frac{π}{4}$ where $n ∈ ℤ$. Now consider $g(z)=f(z) / h(z)$ for $z ≠ a_n$, so that $a_n$ are isolated singularity of $g$. Now $|g(z)|≤1$ for all $z ≠ a_n$, thus $a_n$ are all removable, and therefore $g$ is (extended to be) holomorphic in $ℂ$, and still we have $|g(z)|≤1$, thus $g$ is bounded and holomorphic in $ℂ$, so that $g$ must be constant.

If $a ∈ A$, then all $f^{(n)}(a)=0$ so that $f(z)=0$ for $z ∈ D(a, r)$, and therefore $f^{(n)}(z)=0$ too for all $n ≥ 0$ and $z ∈ D(a, r)$. Therefore $A$ is open.<br>On the other hand for each $n,\left\{z ∈ R: f^{(n)}(z)=0\right\}$ is the pre-image of $\{0\}$ under $f^{(n)}$ which is continuous, and therefore is closed. It follows that

<li>Identity Theorem. Suppose $f$ is holomorphic on a connected open set $R ⊆ ℂ$, $a ∈ R$ and there is a sequence of $z_n ∈ R∖\{a\}, z_n → a,f\left(z_n\right)=0$ for $n=1,2, ⋯$, then $f(z)=0$ for all $z ∈ R$.<br>
Proof. Let $A$ as defined above. By Taylor's expansion
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^∞ a_n(z-a)^n \text { for }{|z-a|}&lt;r
$$
for some $r&gt;0$. We claim that all $a_n=0$.<br>Since $f(a)=\lim_{n → ∞} f\left(z_n\right)=0$, so $a_0=0$.<br>Suppose there is $k ∈ ℕ$, such that $a_k ≠ 0$, and $a_n=0$ for $n&lt;k$, then
$$
\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^k}=a_k+a_{k+1}(z-a)^{k+1}+⋯
$$
for any $0&lt;{|z-a|}&lt;r$. In particular
$$
0=\frac{f\left(z_n\right)}{\left(z_n-a\right)^k}=a_k+a_{k+1}\left(z_n-a\right)^{k+1}+⋯
$$
so by letting $n → ∞$ we obtain that $a_k=0$ which contradicts to the assumption. Therefore $f^{(k)}(a)=0$ for all $k$. Hence $a ∈ A$, thus $A$ is non-empty, so that $A=R$, which means that $f(z)=0$ for every $z ∈ R$.</li></ol>

<li>
<ol type="i"><li>If $a$ is an isolated singularity for $f$, then there is $r&gt;0$, we have Laurent's expansion about $a$ in the following form
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=1}^∞ c_{-n}(z-a)^{-n}+\sum_{n=1}^∞ c_n(z-a)^n \text { for } 0&lt;|z-a|&lt;r
$$
here the coefficient
$$
c_n=\frac1{2 π i} ∫_{C(a, ρ)} \frac{f(w)}{(w-a)^{n+1}} d w
$$
where $0&lt;ρ&lt;r$. The coefficient of $(z-a)^{-1}$, that is,
\begin{equation}
c_{-1}=\frac1{2 π i} ∫_{C(a, ρ)} f(z) d z
\end{equation}
is called the residue of $f$ at $a$. [It is an acceptable answer that the residue of $f$ at $a$ is given by (1).] $a$ is essential if there are infinite many $c_{-n}($ where $n ∈ ℕ$) do not vanish.
</li>
<li>Suppose ${|f(z)|}≤M$ for $n ≥ 1,0&lt;ρ&lt;δ$, we have by Estimation Lemma
$$
\left|c_{-n}\right|≤\frac1{2 π} 2 π ρ \max_{|w-a|=ρ}\left|\frac{f(w)}{(w-a)^{-n+1}}\right|≤ρ^n M
$$
by letting $ρ ↓ 0$ we may conclude that all $c_{-n}$ vanish for $n=1,2, ⋯$, so $a$ is not essential by definition.
</li>
<li>For every complex number $C$, $a$ is an essential singularity of $f(z)-C$ too. If there is a sequence $z_n → a$ such that $f\left(z_n\right)-C=0$, then we are done. Otherwise, there is $r&gt;0$ such that $f(z)-C ≠ 0$ has on $D(a, r)∖\{a\}$ for some $r&gt;0$. Now consider the function $h(z)=\frac1{f(z)-C}$ for $0&lt;|z-a|&lt;r$, so that $a$ is an isolated singularity. We show that $h$ is unbounded. Suppose $h$ is bounded, then $a$ is a removable singularity of $h$ so that $\lim_{z → a} h(z)$ exists. If $h(z) → 0$, then $a$ is a zero of $h$. Since $h$ is not identically equal to zero, so that $a$ is an isolated zero. Hence $h(z)=(z-a)^k g(z)$ where $g(z)$ is holomorphic, and has no zero in $|z-a|&lt;r$ for some $r&gt;0$. Hence
$$
f(z)=C+\frac1{h(z)}=C+\frac1{(z-a)^k} \frac1{g(z)}
$$
and therefore $a$ is a pole of order $k$, not an essential one, which is a contradiction. Hence $h(a) ≠ 0$. In this case $h ≠ 0$ is holomorphic in $D(a, r)$ for some $r&gt;0$, hence $f(z)=C+\frac1{h(z)}$ is holomorphic up to $a$ too, thus $a$ is removable, a contradiction too.<br>
We therefore can conclude that $a$ is an essential singularity of $h$ too. In particular $h$ is unbounded, hence there is $z$ such that $0&lt;|z-a|&lt;δ$ but $|h(z)|&gt;\frac1ε$, that is $|f(z)-C|&lt;ε$.</li></ol></li></ol></li>

Let’s do the substitution $z=e^{i θ}$ with $θ: 0 → 2 π$ in the integral on the left-hand side, which is denoted by $I$ for simplicity. Then $d θ=d z /(i z), \cos θ=\frac12\left(z+\frac1{z}\right)$ so that $I$ can be turned into the following contour integral
\begin{aligned}
I &=∫_{C(0,1)} \frac1{1-p\left(z+\frac1{z}\right)+p^2} \frac{d z}{i z} \\
&=\frac1{i} ∫_{C(0,1)} \frac1{z-p\left(z^2+1\right)+p^2 z} d z \\
&=\frac1{i} ∫_{C(0,1)} \frac1{(z-p)(1-p z)} d z \\
&=2 π \frac1{1-p p}=\frac{2 π}{1-p^2}
\end{aligned}
where the last equality follows from the Cauchy formula applying to function $\frac1{1-p z}$ at point $p$, which is holomorphic in $D\left(0, \frac1{|p|}\right)$.</li>
<li>Let $f(z)=\frac{\ln^2 z}{1+z^2}$ where $\ln z$ is a holomorphic branch to be chosen later. Set up contour as the following. Let $0&lt;ε&lt;R$ where $ε&lt;1$ and $R&gt;1$. The contour $Γ$ consists of the upper semi-circle $C_R$ with center zero and radius $R$, starting at $R$ to $-R$, which has a parameterization $z=R e^{i θ}, θ: 0 → π$ and $d z=i R e^{i θ} d θ$. The second part $Γ_2$ is the section along the real line $[-R,-ε]$, and the 3rd part $Γ_3$ is $[ε, R]$, both has parameterization $z=x$ and $d z=d x$. The last part is the small semi-circle $C_ε^-$ center at 0 with radius $ε$, with clock-wise orientation, so that it has parameterization $z=ε e^{i t}$ where $t: π → 0$, and $d z=i ε e^{i t} d t$<br>
Choose a holomorphic branch $\ln z$ so that it is holomorphic inside the contour, so we may choose
$$
\ln z=\ln |z|+i \arg z, \text { with }-\frac{π}2&lt;\arg z&lt;\frac{3 π}2
$$
Then $f$ has one simple pole $i$ inside the contour $Γ$, whose residue
$$
\operatorname{Res}(f, i)=\left.\frac{\ln^2 z}{\left(1+z^2\right)'}\right|_{z=i}=\frac{\ln^2 i}{2 i}=\frac1{2 i}\left(\frac{π}2 i\right)^2=-\frac1{2 π i} \frac{π^3}{4}
$$
so that by Residue Theorem
$$
∫_{Γ} f(z) d z=2 π i \operatorname{Res}(f, i)=-\frac{π^3}{4}
$$
On the other hand,
\begin{align}
\nonumber&∫_{Γ_2} f(z) d z+∫_{Γ_3} f(z) d z\\\nonumber&=∫_{-R}^{-ε} \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x+∫_ε^R \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x\\
&\nonumber=∫_{-R}^{-ε} \frac{(\ln |x|+i π)^2}{1+x^2} d x+∫_ε^R \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x\\
&=2 π i ∫_ε^R \frac{\ln x}{1+x^2} d x-π^2 ∫_ε^R \frac1{1+x^2} d x+2 ∫_ε^R \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x
\end{align}
While the path integral
$$
∫_{C_R} f(z) d z=∫_0^π \frac{(\ln R+i θ)^2}{1+R^2 e^{2 θ i}} i R e^{i θ} d θ
$$
so that
$$
\left|∫_{C_R} f(z) d z\right|≤π \frac{(\ln R+π)^2}{R^2-1} R → 0 \text { as } R ↑ ∞
$$
Similarly
$$
∫_{C_ε^-} f(z) d z=-∫_0^π \frac{(\ln ε+i t)^2}{1+ε^2 e^{2 t i}} i ε e^{i t} d t
$$
so that
$$
\left|∫_{C_ε^-} f(z) d z\right|≤π \frac{(\ln ε+π)^2}{1-ε^2} ε→ 0\text{ as }ε ↓ 0
$$
Therefore by letting $ε ↓ 0$ then by letting $R ↑ ∞$ in (2) to obtain
$$
2 π i ∫_0^∞ \frac{\ln x}{1+x^2} d x-π^2 ∫_0^∞ \frac1{1+x^2} d x+2 ∫_0^∞ \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x=\lim_{\substack{R ↑ ∞\\ε ↓ 0}} ∫_{Γ} f(z) d z=-\frac{π^3}{4}
$$
Therefore we must have, by comparing the real parts of two sides in the above equation,
$$
-π^2 ∫_0^∞ \frac1{1+x^2} d x+2 ∫_0^∞ \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x=-\frac{π^3}{4}
$$
so that
$$
2 ∫_0^∞ \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x=π^2 ∫_0^∞ \frac1{1+x^2} d x-\frac{π^3}{4}=π^2 \frac{π}2-\frac{π^3}{4}=\frac{π^3}{4}
$$
and therefore
$$
∫_0^∞ \frac{\ln^2 x}{1+x^2} d x=\frac{π^3}{8}
$$

<ol type="i"><li>By Taylor's expansion
$$
f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^∞ a_n(z-a)^n
$$
for all $z$ such that $|z-a|&lt;r$, where $r&gt;0$ is any such that $D(a, r) ⊆ D(0,1)$. If $f$ is not identically equal to zero, then not all $a_n=0$, thus, there is $m$ such that $a_m ≠ 0$ but $a_l=0$ for any $l&lt;m$. Hence
$$
f(z)=(z-a)^m \sum_{n=k}^∞ a_k(z-a)^{n-m}=(z-a)^m g(z)
$$
where $g(z)=\sum_{n=k}^∞ a_n(z-a)^{n-m}$ which is holomorphic and $g(a) ≠ 0$. If $f$ is not identically equal to zero, then $a$ is an isolated zero, so that $a$ is an isolated singularity of $f' / f$. In fact, since $f'(z)=m(z-a)^{m-1} g(z)+(z-a)^m g'(z)$, so that
\begin{aligned}
\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} &=\frac{m(z-a)^{m-1} g(z)+(z-a)^m g'(z)}{(z-a)^m g(z)} \\
&=\frac{m}{z-a}+\frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}
\end{aligned}
Since $g(a) ≠ 0$, so $g' / g$ is holomorphic near $a$, thus $a$ is a simple pole of $f' / f$.
</li>
<li>Similar to (i), if $a$ is a zero of $f$, then
\begin{aligned}
ϕ(z) \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} &=ϕ(z) \frac{m(z-a)^{m-1} g(z)+(z-a)^m g'(z)}{(z-a)^m g(z)} \\
&=\frac{m}{z-a} ϕ(z)+ϕ(z) \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)} .
\end{aligned}
Since $g(a) ≠ 0$ and $g$ and $ϕ$ are holomorphic, so that $a$ is a simple pole of $ϕ(z) \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}$, whose residue equals
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{z → a}(z-a) ϕ(z) \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} &=\lim_{z → a} m ϕ(z)+\lim_{z → a}(z-a) ϕ(z) \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)} \\
&=m ϕ(a) .
\end{aligned}
Therefore, according to the Residue Theorem
$$
\frac1{2 π i} ∫_{C(0,1)} ϕ(z) \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} d z=\sum_{i=1}^k \operatorname{Res}\left(ϕ(z) \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}, a_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^k m_i ϕ\left(a_i\right)

If $|α|&gt;1$, then $|w|&gt;1$ if and only if $|z|&lt;1$. That is, if $|α|&lt;1$, then $φ(D)=D$, and if $|α|&gt;1$ then $φ(D)=D^c$.

<li>The circle $|z|=1$ intersects the real axis at $±1$, thus we first apply the Möbius transformation $f_1$ which sends 1 to $0$, $-1$ to $∞$, that is
$$
f_1(z)=\frac{z-1}{z+1}
$$
Now $i$∈upper semi-circle $\{z:|z|=1,\operatorname{Im} z&gt;0\}$, and

$0 ∈$real axis, and $f_1(0)=-1$, so $f_1$ maps the real axis to real axis.<br>
Choose a point say $i / 2$ inside the domain $R$. Since
$$
f\left(\frac{i}2\right)=\frac{i-2}{i+2}=\frac{(i-2)(-i+2)}{5}=\frac{-3+4 i}{5}

we thus may conclude that

f(z)=e^{i θ} \frac{-\left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)^2-a}{-\left(\frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)^2-\bar{a}}
