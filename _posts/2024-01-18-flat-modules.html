<strong>Definition 6.25.</strong> A module $F$ is <strong>flat</strong> if $-⊗_R F$ is an exact functor.
<strong>Lemma 6.26.</strong> Let $B$ be a left $R$-module. The following are equivalent:
<ol>
<li>$B$ is flat.
<li>$\Tor_n^R(A, B)=0$ for all $n \geq 1$ and all left $R$-modules $A$.
<li>$\Tor_1^R(A, B)=0$ for all left $R$-modules $A$.
</ol>
<em>Proof.</em> Suppose that $B$ is flat. Let $F_• → A$ be a free resolution of $A$. Since $-⊗_R B$ is exact, the sequence 
\[ … → F_2 ⊗_R B → F_1 ⊗_R B → F_0 ⊗_R B → A ⊗_R B → 0 \]
is exact, so the homology of
\[
… → F_2 ⊗_R B → F_1 ⊗_R B → F_0 ⊗_R B → 0
\]
vanishes in positive degree. Therefore, we have (1)⟹(2).
The implication (2)⟹(3) is trivial.
Finally, (3)⟹(1) follows from the long exact sequence of Tor, since for any short exact sequence $0 → X → Y → Z → 0$, we have that
\[
0=\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(Z, B) → X ⊗ B → Y ⊗ B → Z ⊗ B → 0
\]
is exact.</div>
