<ol start="2"><li>
<ol type="a"><li>Show that a group whose order is the square of a prime is Abelian. [You may assume that a group of prime power order has a nontrivial centre.] Give two examples of non-Abelian groups whose order is the cube of a prime.
</li>
<li>Let $G$ be a group whose order $|G|$ is the product of two distinct primes. Stating carefully any theorems that you need, show that $G$ has a nontrivial cyclic normal subgroup. What does this tell you about the structure of $G$ ?
</li>
<li>Let $|G|=43681=11^2 19^2$. Show that $G$ is Abelian and list all the possible groups $G$.
</li>
<li>Now let $|G|=11^2 p^2$ where $p ≠ 11$ is prime. For which $p$ can we still conclude that $G$ must be Abelian?
</li>
<li>Give an example, with justification, of an odd prime $p$ such that there is a non-Abelian group of order $11^2 p^2$.

<h1>Solution</h1>
<ol start="2"><li><ol type="a"><li>First suppose that $G$ contains an element $x$ of order $p^2$. Then ${|⟨x⟩|}={|G|}$, and hence $G≅C_{p^2}$.<br>
Now suppose that $G$ does not contain an element of order $p^2$. Let $x$ be any element in $Z(G)∖\{1\}$. Then ${|x|}={|⟨x⟩|}=p$. Pick any element $y ∈ G∖⟨x⟩$. Then again the subgroup $⟨y⟩$ has order $p$, and Lagrange guarantees that $⟨x⟩∩⟨y⟩=\{1\}$. Moreover, $⟨x, y⟩$ is a subgroup of order $p^2$ of $G$ (again Lagrange) and hence coincides with $G$. Since $x∈Z(G)$, the following map is an isomorphism:
$$
ϕ:⟨x⟩×⟨y⟩→G,  (x^a, y^b) ↦ x^a y^b
$$Thus, $G ≅⟨x⟩×⟨y⟩≅ C_p×C_p$ in this case.
</li>
<li>Let $p>q$ be primes. $n_p≡1\pmod p,n_p|q⇒n_p=1$. So there is a unique Sylow $p$-subgroup, which is normal and isomorphic to $C_p$.</li>
