<div style="white-space:pre-wrap"><a href="https://faculty.etsu.edu/gardnerr/Func/notes/4-3.pdf">Theorem 4.12.</a> Suppose $X$ is a uniformly convex Banach space. For any point $x$ and a nonempty closed convex set $K$, there is a nearest point to $x$ in $K$.


$L^p$ spaces with $1<p<\infty$ are uniformly convex spaces. [reference: A Short Course on Banach Spaces by N.L. Carothers, Cambridge University Press (2005).]
For $p \geq 2$, this is an exercise (pages 87 and 88) in Reed and Simon's Functional Analysis I, Academic Press (1980).</div>
