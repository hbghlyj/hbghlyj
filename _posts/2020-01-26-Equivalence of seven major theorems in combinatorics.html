<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
    The seven following theorems, while
    seemingly unrelated, are equivalent (i.e., any one of them may be
    proved by assuming any other is true).  These theorems relate to
    graph theory, set theory, flow theory, and even marriage: Menger's
    theorem (1929), Kőnig's theorem for matrices (1931), the
    Kőnig-Egeváry theorem (1931), Hall's marriage theorem (1935),
    the Birkhoff-Von Neumann theorem (1946), Dilworth's theorem (1950)
    and the Max Flow-Min Cut theorem (1962). I will attempt to explain
    each theorem, and give some indications why all are equivalent.
</p>


<h1>Graph Theory</h1>

<p>
    A <i>graph</i> can be defined as a set of points, called
    <i>vertices</i> or <i>nodes</i>, and a set of 2-element sets of
    points, called <i>edges</i>.
</p>

<p>
    We say a graph is <i>bipartite</i> if it's vertices can be
    partitioned into two disjoint sets such that all edges in the
    graph go from one set to the other.  A <i>covering</i> of the
    edges in a graph is a set C of vertices such that each edge of the
    graph contains at least one vertex of C.
</p>

<h2>Kőnig's Theorem</h2>
<p>
    Let $G$ be a bipartite graph.  The
    size of a maximum matching of $G$ is equal to the size of a minimum
    covering of $G$.
</p>



<h1>Menger's Theorem</h1>

<p>
    Let $G$ be a graph, $v$ and $w$ vertices in $G$, and $S$ be a subset of
    vertices. $S$ is a <i>$vw$-separating set</i> if there is no path from
    $v$ to $w$ in $G∖S$. Two paths from $v$ to $w$ are
    <i>vertex-disjoint</i> if they only have $v$ and $w$ in common.
</p>

<h2>Menger's Theorem (1929)</h2>
<p>The maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths connecting two distinct non-adjacent vertices $v$ and $w$ is equal to the minimum number of vertices in a $vw$-separating set.</p>



<h1>Flow Theory</h1>

<p>
    A <i>directed graph</i> is a graph in which each edge has
    associated with it a direction.  A <i>network</i> is a directed
    graph with two distinct vertices singled out as the <i>source</i>
    s and the <i>target</i> t, and with each edge assigned an integer
    called it's <i>capacity</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Let S be a set of vertices, and S' it's complement.  We define an
    <i>edge cut</i> [S, S'] as all the edges directed from S to S'. A
    <i>minimum edge cut</i> is one such that the sum of the capacities
    of the edges in [S, S'] is a minimum.
</p>

<p>
    The easiest example to see would be a system of pipes, with water
    flowing from one source to one target where the capacities are the
    diameter of the pipes.  You can also look at any kind of product
    distribution line as an example of a network.
</p>

<p>
    The <i>flow</i> on an edge uv is f(u,v), a positive integer such
    that f(u,v) $\leq$ the capacity of uv, and $f^+(v) = f^-(v)$ (the
    out flow from v equals the inflow to v).  We will say a
    <i>flow</i> in the network N is a valid assignment of flows on all
    the edges. The value of a flow in N is $f^+(s) - f^-(s)$. A
    <i>maximum flow</i> is one whose value is maximum.
</p>

<h2>The Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem</h2>
<p>A value of a maximum flow in a network N is equal to the value of a minimum cut of N.</p>



<h1>(0,1)-Matrices and the Kőnig-Egeváry theorem</h1>

<p>
    The <i>Term Rank</i> of a (0,1)-matrix is the largest number of 1s
    that can be chosen from the matrix such that no 2 selected 1s lie
    on the same line.  A set S of rows and columns is a <i>cover</i>
    of a (0,1)-matrix if the matrix becomes a zero matrix after all
    the lines in S have been deleted.
</p>

<h2>Kőnig-Egeváry theorem (1931)</h2>
<p>The term rank of a (0,1)-matrix is the cardinality of its smallest cover.</p>



<h1>The Birkhoff-Von Neumann Theorem</h1>

<p>
    A matrix D = ($d_{ij}$) with real non-negative entries is
    <i>Doubly Stochastic</i> if the sum of the entries in any row and
    any column equals 1.  A <i>Permutation Matrix</i> is a doubly
    stochastic matrix with entries 0 and 1, that is, a matrix with
    exactly one 1 in each row and in each column.  A matrix A is a
    <i>convex combination</i> of matrices $A_1, ..., A_s$ if there
    exist non-negative reals $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_s$ such that $A
    = \sum^s_{i=1} \lambda_i A_i$ and $\sum^s_{i=1} \lambda_i = 1$.
</p>

<h2>Birkhoff-Von Neumann Theorem (1946)</h2>
<p>Any doubly stochastic matrix can be written as a convex combination permutation matrices.</p>


<h1>Hall's Theorem</h1>

<p>
    Let $X$ be a set of elements.  Let $S=\{S_1, ..., S_n\}$ be a
    family of subsets of $X$.  Then, a <i>Sequence of Distinct
    Representatives</i> (SDR) for $S$ is a sequence $\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ of
    pairwise distinct elements of X such that $x_i∈S_i, 1 \leq i
    \leq n$
</p>

<h2>Hall's Theorem</h2>
<p>$S$ has an SDR if and only if the union of any $k$ members of $S$ contains at least $k$ elements.</p>

<center>
Example: <br>
$X = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ <br>
$S_1 = \{1, 2, 3\}, S_2 = \{1, 4, 5\}, S_3 = \{3, 5\}$<br>
SDR: $\{1, 4, 5\}$
</center>



<h1>The Marriage Theorem</h1>

<p>This was the original motivation for Hall's Theorem:</p>

<p>
    Given a set of $n$ men and a set of $n$ women, let each man make a
    list of the women he is willing to marry.  Then each man can be
    married to a woman on his list if, and only if, for every value of
    $k\ (1≤k≤n)$, the union of any $k$ of the lists contain
    at least $k$ names.
</p>

<p>Similarly, we can apply this theorem to the Assignment Problem:</p>

<p>
    Given a set of $n$ employees, fill out a list of the jobs each of
    them would be able to preform.  Then, we can give each person a
    job suited to their abilities if, and only if, for every value of
    $k\ (1≤k≤n)$, the union of any $k$ of the lists contains
    at least $k$ jobs.
</p>



<h1>Partially Ordered Sets and Dilworth's Theorem</h1>

<p>
    We define a <i>Partially Ordered Set</i>, or a <i>Poset</i>, as a
    set P with a partial ordering $\leq$ defined on it's elements.
    I.e, for any two elements x and y of P, either x $\leq$ y, y
    $\leq$ x (x and y are comparable), or x $||$ y (x and y are
    incomparable). A <i>Chain</i> is any pairwise comparable subset of
    P, and an <i>Antichain</i> is any pairwise incomparable subset of
    P.
</p>

<h2>Dilworth's Theorem</h2>
<p>Suppose that the largest antichain in the poset $P$ has size $r$. Then $P$ can be partitioned into $r$ disjoint chains.</p>

<h1>The Kőnig-Egeváry theorem ⇔ Kőnig's Theorem</h1>
<p>
    Let the bipartite graph $G$ have bipartitions $X = \{x_1, x_2, ...,
    x_m\}$ and $Y = \{y_1, y_2, ..., y_m\}$.  Construct the m*n
    adjacency matrix $A$ with $A_{ij}=1$ if, and only if, there is an
    edge joining $x_i$ to $y_j$. Now, the term rank of A is the
    cardinality of a maximum matching in $G$, and the size of a smallest
    cover of A is the size of a smallest covering of the edges of G.
</p>
<p>
    So, we have that the Kőnig-Egeváry Theorem ⇒
    Kőnig's Theorem. Conversely, since any (0,1)-matrix can be
    interpreted as the adjacency matrix of some bipartite graph,
    Kőnig's Theorem ⇒ the Kőnig-Egeváry Theorem.
</p>

<h1>Hall's Theorem ⇒ The Kőnig-Egeváry Theorem</h1>

<p>Sketch: Let B be an m*n (0,1)-matrix, p = term rank of B, q = cardinality of smallest cover.</p>

<p>
    Claim: $p ≤ q$.  Removing r rows and s columns (r + s = q)
    removes all the ones from the matrix.  Thus, there are at most r +
    s ones in different rows and columns.  Thus p ≤ q.
</p>

<p>
    Claim: $p ≥ q$.  Permute the rows and columns of B (as figure).
    Let $A_i = \{j : j > s\text{ and }B_{ij}= 1\}$.  Note $|A_i| > 0$
    for all $i$. Also, the union of any $k$ of the $A_i$'s has at least $k$
    elements. If not, we would be able to replace $k$ rows of the
    smallest cover with less than $k$ columns.  Thus, by Hall's theorem,
    we have r ones in the top right, each in it's own row and column.
</p>

<p>Similarly, we get s ones in the bottom left, each in it's own row and column.  So, p ≥ r + s = q.  So, p = q.</p>

<h1>Dilworth's Theorem ⇒ Hall's Theorem</h1>

<p>Sketch: Let $S_1, S_2, ..., S_n$ be the subsets of $\{x_1, ..., x_m\}$</p>

<p>
    Assume that the union of any k sets has at least k elements.  Let
    $X = \{S_1, S_2, ..., S_n, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m\}$ and define a
    partial order on X such that $x_i < S_j$ iff $x_i∈A_j$, and
    there are no other comparable elements.
</p>

<p>
    The $x_i$'s form an antichain of length m, and it can be shown this
    is the largest antichain.  So, by Dilworth's theorem, we can
    partition X into m chains, n of which have 2 elements, and the
    rest have 1.  The 2 element chains define an SDR.
</p>


<h1>Konig's Theorem ⇒ Hall's Theorem</h1>

<p>
    Sketch: Let $S = \{S_1, S_2, ..., S_n\}$ be a set of subsets of $X
    = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_m\}$ such that the union of any $k$ members of
    $S$ contains at least $k$ elements.  Construct a bipartite graph $G$
    with bipartitions $X$ and $Y=\{1, ..., n\}$ in which $\{x_i, j\}$
    is an edge if, and only if, $x_i∈S_j$.
</p>

<p>
    Let $K \subseteq Y$.  Define N(K) to be the set of vertices in X
    such that each vertex in N(K) is joined to at least 1 vertex in K.
    Equivalently, $N(K) = \bigcup_{i∈K} S_i$.  By assumption,
    $|N(K)| \geq |K|$ (1).  Now, we need to show that there is a
    matching of Y into X.
</p>

<p>
    By Kőnig's Theorem, a complete matching from Y into X exists if
    and only if the cardinality of every covering of the edges in this
    graph is at least $n$.
</p>

<p>
    Let C be a covering of G.  Let $C_y = C \bigcap Y$.  Then, $N(X
   ∖C_y)$ is a subset of $C∖C_y$ (2).  Thus,
</p>

<center>
$|C| = |C_y| + |C∖C_y|$<br>
$\geq |C_y| + |N(X∖C_y)|$ (by (2)) <br>
$\geq |C_y| + |X∖C_y|$ (by (1)) = m
</center>
