<div style="white-space:pre-wrap">The $℘$-function satisfies $℘'^2=4(℘-e_1)(℘-e_2)(℘-e_3)$. Supposing that none of $e_1,e_2,e_3$ is zero, show that the equation $℘(z)=0$ has two distinct solutions $z= ±a$. For any two distinct points $b,c∈ℂ/Γ$ write down a meromorphic function whose only poles are simple poles at $b$ and $c$.
<strong>Solution.</strong>
Since $℘'(a)^2=-4e_1e_2e_3≠0$, $a$ is not a ramification point, so $℘(z)=0$ has two distinct solutions, let one of them be $a$, then the other is $-a$, since $℘$ is even.
The linear map $\frac{2a}{b-c}(z-b)+a$ maps $b,c$ to $a,-a$.
So $\frac1{℘(\frac{2a}{b-c}(z-b)+a)}$ is a meromorphic function whose only poles are simple poles at $b$ and $c$.</div>
