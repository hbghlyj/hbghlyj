📁 The `_posts` folder
I write posts in HTML. 

The source code live in https://github.com/hbghlyj/hbghlyj/tree/main/_posts

The file name format is `YYYY-MM-DD-title.html`.

Equations are in LaTeX or MathML format. One can be converted to the other by https://pandoc.org/try/

The benefit of LaTeX is that it can be easier edited by hand.

The benefit of MathML is that it can be parsed by Math-aware search engines like https://approach0.xyz/search/.
