My blog posts live in https://github.com/hbghlyj/hbghlyj.github.io/tree/main/_posts
I write posts in HTML. The file name format is `YYYY-MM-DD-title.html`. If you prefer to write in Markdown, you can use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/try/) to convert it to HTML. Equations can either be written in LaTeX or MathML.

The benefit of LaTeX is that it can be easier edited by hand.

The benefit of MathML is that it can be parsed by Math-aware search engines like [Approach0](https://approach0.xyz/search/).
